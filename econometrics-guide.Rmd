# OLS

A linear model with $n$ observations and $k$ regressors can be
written as (in vector forms)
$$ \bf y=X\beta+u $$

The idea of  least-squares is to choose $\beta$ to minimize the
residual sum of squares ($SSR$),

$$ SSR  =  \bf u'u = \bf (y-X\beta)'(y-X\beta) =  \bf y'y-2\beta'X'y+\beta'X'X\beta $$

The first-order condition to minimize $SSR$ are:
$$ \frac{\partial (SSR)}{\partial \beta} = \bf -2X'y+2X'X\beta=0$$

This generates the so-called normal equations
$$\bf (X'X)\beta=X'y$$

Therefore, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimator of $\beta$ is
$$\bf \hat \beta=(X'X)^{-1}X'y$$


## Example
Let's look at an example of OLS of car's mpg on disp, hp and wt.
```{r}
library(car)
lm1 <- lm(mpg~disp+hp+wt, data=mtcars)
summary(lm1)
```
## Fitness of OLS

We can see $y$ vector as the part explained by the regression
and the unexplained part,
$$ \bf y=\hat y+u=X\beta+u$$
Therefore
$$\bf y'y=(\hat y+u)'(\hat y +u)=\hat y' \hat y +u'u=\beta'X'X\beta +u'u $$

Subtracting $n\bar y^2$ ($\bar y$ is the sample mean) from both
sides,
$$ \bf y'y-n\bar y^2=(\beta'X'X\beta-n\bar Y^2) +u'u $$


We decompose the total sum of squares into two parts:  sum of
squares due to error (noise), and sum of squares explained by the
linear regression.

The $R^2$ is defined by
$$R^2=1-\frac{SSR}{SST}$$

$SST$ is the total sum of squares, which is the total variance of $y$, $\bf y'y-n\bar y^2$.

$R^2$ is simply the proportion of the variation of $Y$ that can be
attributed to the variation of $X$.  $R^2$, however, will never
decrease with the addition of any variable to the set of
regressors.  If the added variable is totally irrelevant then
$R^2$ will stay the same.  The adjusted $R^2$, however, takes
account of the addition of any new regressors:

$$\bar R^2=1-\frac{SSR/(n-k)}{SST/(n-1)}$$

## The Geometry of Least Squares

![](figures/ols.jpg)

For simplicity, let's assume there are two explanatory
variables $x_1$ and $x_2$. $x_1$ and $x_2$ form a plane.  What OLS
does is to project $y$ onto this plane.

In mathematical terms, all linear combinations of these two
vectors define a two-dimensional subspace of Euclidean space ${\rm \bf
E}^n$.  This is called the column space of $\bf X$.  The least-square
principle is to choose $\beta$ to make $\hat y$, which belongs to the
subspace of $\bf X$, as close as possible to $y$.

When we estimate a linear regression model, we map the $y$ into a vector of fitted values $\bf X \hat \beta$ and a vector of residuals $\bf \hat u =y-X \hat \beta$.  Geometrically, these are examples of orthogonal projections.  A projection is a mapping that takes each point of ${\rm \bf E}^n$ into a point in a subspace of ${\rm \bf E}^n$.  An orthogonal projection maps any point into the point of the subspace that is closest to it.

An orthogonal projection  can be performed by premultiplying the vector to be projected by a projection matrix.  In the case of OLS, the two projection matrices that yield the vector of fitted values and the vector of residuals, are $$\bf P_X = \bf X(X'X)^{-1}X' $$ $$\bf M_X = \bf I-P_X = I- \bf X(X'X)^{-1}X'$$

From this, we see that the effects of two projection matrices.
$$\bf P_X y  =  \bf X \hat \beta =\bf \hat y  $$
$$\bf M_X y  =  \bf (I-P_X)y = y- \bf P_X y = y-X \hat \beta =\hat u $$

That is, $\bf P_X y$ projects $\bf y$ onto $\bf X$ and makes it $\bf \hat y$; $\bf M_X y$ makes it $\bf \hat u$.

In the picture, that corresponds to the fact that the projection of $\bf y$ onto the plane of $\bf X$ creates two parts:  $\bf \hat y$ and $\bf \hat u$.


## Properties of OLS estimator

### Unbiasedness
In a linear model
$$
\bf y=X\beta+u,
$$
 the OLS estimator is
$$
\bf \hat \beta=(X'X)^{-1}X'y
$$

Since $\bf y=X \beta+u$,

$$
\bf \hat \beta=\beta + (X'X)^{-1}X'u.
$$

This makes
$$
{\rm E} \bf (\hat \beta)=\beta + (X'X)^{-1}X'{\rm E} (u|X).
$$

The condition that makes the OLS estimator unbiased is:
$$
{\rm E} \bf (u|X)=0,
\label{exog}
$$

that is, all explanatory variables which form the columns of $\bf X$
are exogenous.  This condition is weaker than the independence
condition that $u$ and $X$ are independent. This says that given $\bf
X$, the expected value of $\bf u$ is zero; it implies that the model
is correctly specified.  That is, $\bf y$ is a linear function of $\bf
X$.

In the context of cross-sectional data, this assumption is plausible.
However, when we have time series data, the assumption becomes strong,
because it assumes that the entire series of $\bf X$ has no
relationship with the error term.  In a time series context, this is
hard to satisfy.  The OLS estimator is biased if this condition
is not satisfied.

For example, suppose we have a model

$$ y_t = \beta_1 + \beta_2 y_{t-1} + u_t, \quad u_t \sim {\rm IID} (0, \sigma^2). $$

In this simple model, even if we assume that $y_{t-1}$ and $u_t$ are
uncorrelated, OLS estimator is still biased.  That is because
${\rm E} \bf (u|X)=0$
is not satisfied: $y_{t-1}$ depends on $u_{t-1}$,
$u_{t-2}$ and so on.


There is a weaker condition:
$$
{\rm E} \bf (X u)=0,
\label{exog2}
$$

Once we know that the model is correctly specified, then this equation can be used to derive results, such as GMM estimators.

### Consistency

For OLS estimator to be consistent, a much weaker condition is needed:
$$
{\rm E} (u_t|X_t)=0,
\label{pred}
$$

This condition is much weaker since it only assumes that the mean of current error term does not depend on the current predictors.  Even a model with lagged dependent variable can easily satisfy this condition.  This condition is called predeterminedness condition, or say regressors are predetermined.  So in the time series example, OLS estimator is biased, but can be consistent, if we are willing to assume no contemporaneous correlation.

# The Method of Maximum Likelihood

If we make the assumption that the error terms are normally
distributed, the maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) coincide with
the  least square estimators.  But MLE can also be applied
to a wide variety of models other than regression models, and it
generally generates estimators with excellent asymptotic
properties.  The major disadvantage of MLE is that it requires
stronger distributional assumptions than does the method of
moments.

## Basic Concepts

Maximum likelihood estimation is to find the set of parameters which makes the current sample most likely given the statistical model.

Suppose we have a sample of $n$ independent and identically distributed (IID) observations.  Each of them comes from some distribution function $f(\cdot, \bf \theta)$, where  parameters $\bf \theta$ is fixed.  The joint distribution of all the data points would be

$$ f(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n | \theta) = f(x_1 | \theta) \times f(x_2 | \theta) \times \dots \times f(x_n | \theta). $$

It is referred to as the likelihood function of the model for the
given data set.

Then it's natural to estimate $\theta$ by picking the $\theta$ that maximize this joint distriubtion function.    A parameter vector $\hat \bf \theta$ at which the
likelihood takes on its maximum value is called a maximum likelihood
estimate, or MLE, of the parameters.

Usually the log form of the likelihood function is preferred for computational purposes.

## MLE for a linear model

Consider the classical normal linear model:

$$
\bf y=X\beta+u, \quad u \sim N(0, \sigma^2 I)
$$

In this case, we have two parameters to estimate, $\sigma$ and $\bf \beta$.  The distribution of $\bf y | X$ is

$$ f({\bf y, \beta, \sigma | X}) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} \exp(-  \frac{({\bf y- X \beta})^2}{2 \sigma^2})$$

The log-likelihood function is

$$ l({\bf y, \beta, \sigma}) = -\frac{n}{2} \log{2 \pi} - \frac{n}{2} \log{2 \sigma^2} - \frac{1}{2 \sigma^2} \sum_{t=1}^n \bf (y-X \beta)'(y-X \beta) $$

The maximization of the log-likelihood function will lead to the same estimator as the OLS estimator, for $\bf \beta$.  For $\sigma^2$, the MLE estimator is slightly different in limited sample, but asymptotically the same.  This is strictly based on the assumption of normally distributed error term.  Otherwise, these two estimators will be different.


## Asymptotic Properties of MLE

1.  Consistency
$$
{\rm plim} (\bf \hat \theta)=\theta.
$$

This is to say that MLE estimator can get arbitrarily close to the true parameter if the sample size gets to infinity.

2.  Asymptotic Normality
$$
{\bf \hat \theta} \sim^a N(\bf \theta, I^{-1}(\theta)).
$$

This states that the asymptotic distribution of $\bf \hat \theta$
is normal with mean $\bf \theta$ and variance given by the inverse
of $\bf I(\theta)$, the information matrix, defined by

$$
{\bf I(\theta)}=E[(\frac{\partial l}{\partial
\theta})(\frac{\partial l}{\partial
\theta})']=-E[(\frac{\partial^2 l}{\partial \theta \partial
\theta'})]
$$

The information matrix is the expected value of the inner product of gradient of the log-likelihood function, or the negative value of the expected value of the Hessian (second derivative of the log-likelihood function.

3.  Asymptotic efficiency.

If $\bf \hat \theta$ is the MLE estimator of $\theta$, $\bf V$ denotes the variance covariance matrix of $\bf \hat \theta$, then
$$
\sqrt n (\hat \theta -\theta) \rightarrow^d N(\bf 0, V)
$$

If $\bf \tilde V$ denotes the variance matrix of any other consistent,
asymptotically normal estimator, then $\bf \tilde V- V$ is a positive
semidefinite matrix. That means MLE estimator is the best (in terms of variance) consistent and asymptotically normal estimator.

4.  Invariance.

If $\hat \theta$ is the MLE of $\theta$ and $g(\theta)$ is a
continuous function of $\theta$, then $g(\hat \theta)$ is the MLE of
$g(\theta)$.


## Example
Let's look at the example of regression of car's mpg on disp, hp and wt. This time we use MLE. (R has a mle() function which I cannot make it work on this example.  So I am using optim().)

```{r}
library(car)
library(stats4)
ols.lf <- function(theta, y, X) {
  beta <- theta[-1]
  sigma2 <- theta[1]
  if (sigma2 <= 0) return(NA)
  n <- nrow(X)
  e <- y - X%*%beta
  logl <- ((-n/2)*log(2*pi)) - ((n/2)*log(sigma2)) - ((t(e)%*%e)/(2*sigma2))
  return(-logl)
}
X <- cbind(1,mtcars[,c('disp','hp','wt')])
y <- mtcars$mpg

# note that I have a rough idea of the starting values from OLS esimators first; otherwise it may converge to some wrong local maximum.  Annoying.
optim(c(1,1,-1,-1,-1), method="L-BFGS-B", fn=ols.lf, lower=c(1e-6,-Inf,-Inf,-Inf,-Inf), upper=rep(Inf,5), y=y, X=as.matrix(X))

# it should match the OLS estimator

lm1 <- lm(mpg~disp+hp+wt, data=mtcars)
summary(lm1)

```


## Hypotheses Testing

### Linear Hypotheses Testing

Linear hypothesis can be framed as
$$
\rm H_0: \ \ \bf R\beta -r=0,
$$
where $\bf R$ is a $q \times k$ matrix of known constants, with $q <
k$, and $\bf r$ is a $q$-vector of known constants.

We assume that $u_i$ are normally distributed.

$$
\bf u \sim N(0, \sigma^2 I)
$$

Even if this assumption does not hold, we still have asympototic normality for $\bf u$.

Since linear combination of normal variables are also normally
distributed,
$$
\bf \hat \beta \sim N(\beta, \sigma^2 (X'X)^{-1})\\
\bf R \hat \beta \sim N(R \beta, \sigma^2 R(X'X)^{-1}R')\\
\bf R (\hat \beta - \beta) \sim N(0, \sigma^2 R(X'X)^{-1}R')
$$

Under null hypothesis,

$$
\bf (R \hat \beta - r) \sim N(0, \sigma^2 R(X'X)^{-1}R')
$$

Therefore,
$$
{\bf (R \hat \beta - r)'[\sigma^2 R(X'X)^{-1}R']^{-1} (R \hat
\beta - r)} \sim \chi^2(q)
$$

Here we don't know $\sigma^2$.  However, it can be shown that
$$
{\bf \frac{\hat u' u}{\sigma^2}} \sim \chi^2(n-k)
$$

Then we have
$$
{\bf \frac{(R \hat \beta - r)'[ R(X'X)^{-1}R']^{-1} (R \hat \beta
- r)/q}{\hat u' \hat u / (n-k)}} \sim F(q, n-k)
$$

This is an example of the $F$ test for any linear hypotheses testing.  $t$ test will be a special case of this.

## Test of Structural Change (Chow test)

Chow test is a test between two groups of observations.  For example,
we have data on consumption function of prewar period and postward
period.  It is natural to think of a test on whether consumption
function parameters differ between prewar and postwar periods.  The
null hypothesis is that there is no difference.

Let $\bf y_i$, $\bf X_i$ ($i=1,2)$ indicate the appropriate
partitioning of the data.  The unrestricted model may be written

$$\bf
\begin{bmatrix}\bf
y_1 \\ \bf y_2
\end{bmatrix}=
\begin{bmatrix}\bf
X_1 & \bf 0 \\ \bf 0 & \bf X_2
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}\bf
\beta_1 \\ \bf \beta_2
\end{bmatrix}
+u \quad u \sim N(0, \sigma^2I)
$$

The null hypothesis of no structural break is

$$
\rm H_0: \ \ \bf \beta_1 = \beta_2.
$$

Running OLS on two equations separately, we have

$$\bf
\begin{bmatrix}\bf
\hat \beta_1 \\ \bf \hat \beta_2
\end{bmatrix}=
\begin{bmatrix}\bf
X_1' X_1 & \bf 0 \\ \bf 0 & \bf X_2' X_2
\end{bmatrix}^{-1}
\begin{bmatrix}\bf
X_1' y_1 \\ \bf X_2' y_2
\end{bmatrix}
=\begin{bmatrix}\bf (X_1' X_1)^{-1}X_1'y_1 \\ \bf (X_2' X_2)^{-1}
X_2' y_2
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Restricted model under null hypothesis

$$\bf
\begin{bmatrix}\bf
y_1 \\ \bf y_2
\end{bmatrix}=
\begin{bmatrix}\bf
X_1 \\ \bf X_2
\end{bmatrix}
\bf \beta +u
$$

The test of the null hypothesis is given by

$$
{\bf F= \frac{(\hat u_*' \hat u_*- \hat u' \hat u)/k}{\hat u' \hat
u/ (n-2k)}} \sim F(k , n-2k)
$$
where $\hat u_*$ is the residual of the restricted model, $\hat u$ is the stacked residual of two unrestricted models.

For example, for prewar period (suppose there is $n$ observations):

$$
y_1 = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2
$$

For postwar period  (suppose there is $m$ observations):

$$
y_1 = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 x_1 + \gamma_2 x_2
$$

The null hypothesis of no structural break is

$$
\rm H_0: \ \ \bf \beta_0 = \gamma_0, \beta_1 = \gamma_1, \beta_2 = \gamma_2.
$$

Running OLS on two equations separately, we have two sums of squares
of error ($SSR_1$ and $SSR_2$).  The unrestricted error sum of squares
is
$$
SSR_U = SSR_1 + SSR_2
$$


Then run the regression on the stacked sample of $n+m$ observations
and get $SSR_R$.

Then

$$
\frac{(SSR_R-SSR_U)/k}{SSR_U/(n+m-2k)} \sim F_{k, n+m-2k}.
$$

$k$ is number of restrictions; in this example, it is 3.




The other way to do the same test is easier:  simply include
interaction terms between group dummy and dependent variables in the
regression.

For our earlier example, we would estimate the model:



$$
y=\alpha_0 + \alpha_1 x_1 + \alpha_2 x2 + \eta_0 d + \eta_1 x_1d + \eta_2
x_2d
$$

Here $d$ is a dummy variable for postward period.  The Chow test is
simply a test on the hypothesis that all the coefficients involving
$d$ are zero.  A regression of the above model with $n+m$ observations
and a $F$ test are easy to do.

$$
\rm H_0: \ \ \bf \eta_0 = \eta_1 = \eta_2 = 0.
$$

### An example of Chow test in R
Here we use an example from the "strucchange" library.

```{r}
## Example 7.4 from Greene (1993), "Econometric Analysis"
## Chow test on Longley data
data("longley")
library(strucchange)
## use structural change test from the library.
sctest(Employed ~ Year + GNP.deflator + GNP + Armed.Forces, data = longley,
  type = "Chow", point = 7)

## which is equivalent to segmenting the regression via
fac <- factor(c(rep(1, 7), rep(2, 9)))
## here fac is the factor for segmenting it at point 7.
fm0 <- lm(Employed ~ Year + GNP.deflator + GNP + Armed.Forces, data = longley)
fm1 <- lm(Employed ~ fac/(Year + GNP.deflator + GNP + Armed.Forces), data = longley)
## Here anova is returning the F test (Chow test). Equivalent to sctest results.
anova(fm0, fm1)

## estimates from Table 7.5 in Greene (1993)
summary(fm0)
summary(fm1)
```

## Heteroskedasticity and Autocorrelation Consistent Standard Errors

### Variance estimator under homoscedasticity

In OLS regression, the variance-covariance matrix of $\hat \beta$ is $${\rm var} \bf (\hat \beta) = {\rm E}\bf [(\hat \beta-\beta)(\hat \beta -\beta)']
= {\rm E}\bf [(X'X)^{-1}X'uu'X(X'X)^{-1}] = \bf \sigma^2 (X'X)^{-1} $$

 if $${\rm var} \bf (u)=\sigma^2 I$$.

That is, the error term has mean zero and constant variance
(homoscedasticity). The pairwise correlation between error terms
is always zero (no serial correlation).

The estimation of $\sigma^2$:

$$
s^2=\frac{ \bf \hat u' \hat u}{n-k}
$$
is an unbiased estimator of $\sigma^2$ (proof omitted).

The standard estimate of the variance-covariance matrix of the OLS
parameter estimates under the assumption of IID errors is
$$
{\rm \hat {Var}}(\hat \beta)=s^2 \bf (X'X)^{-1}
$$

### White’s estimator

We made strong assumption that the error terms of the regression
model are IID when we estimate the variance-covariance matrix of
OLS estimator.  Under this assumption, the usual estimator of
variance-covariance matrix of $\bf \hat \beta$ is consistent.  Now
let's relax this assumption to only independent but not
identically distributed.  Again, the linear regression models is

$$
\bf y=X\beta+u, \quad {\rm E} (u)=0, \quad {\rm E} (u u')=\Omega,
$$
where $\bf \Omega$ is the error variance-covariance matrix with
diagonal elements being $\sigma_t^2$ for $t^{th}$ element,
off-diagonal elements being zero.  In other words, the error terms
are heteroscedastic.

The variance-covariance matrix of the OLS estimator $\bf \hat
\beta$ is equal to
$$
{\rm Var} \bf (\hat \beta) = {\rm E}\bf [(\hat \beta
-\beta)(\hat
\beta -\beta)'] \\
= \bf [(X'X)^{-1}X'({\rm E}(uu'))X(X'X)^{-1}] \nonumber \\
= \bf  (X'X)^{-1} X' \Omega X (X'X)^{-1} \nonumber
$$

If we know $\sigma_t^2$, then we would be able to estimate this
"sandwich covariance matrix".  But we don't.
$$
{\rm Var} \bf (\hat \beta) = \bf \frac{1}{n}
[\frac{1}{n}(X'X)]^{-1}[\frac{1}{n}X'\Omega
X][\frac{1}{n}(X'X)]^{-1} \nonumber
$$

Let $y_t$ denote the $t$th observation on the dependent variable,
and $x_t'=[1 x_{2t} \cdots x_{kt}]$ denote the $t$th row of the
$\bf X$ matrix.  Then
$$
\bf X' \Omega X=\sum_{t=1}^n \sigma_t^2 x_t x_t'
$$

The White estimator replaces the unknown $\sigma_t^2$ by $\hat u_t^2$,
the estimated OLS residuals.  This provides a consistent estimator of
the variance matrix for the OLS coefficient vector and is particularly
useful since it does not require any specific assumptions about the
form of the heteroscedasticity.

Therefore,
$$
\hat {\rm Var} \bf (\hat \beta) = \bf \frac{1}{n}
[\frac{1}{n}(X'X)]^{-1}[\frac{1}{n}X' \hat \Omega
X][\frac{1}{n}(X'X)]^{-1}\\
\bf \hat \Omega = \rm{diag}  ({\hat u_1^2, \hat u_2^2, \cdots,
\hat u_n^2})
$$

### Newey-West estimator


White's estimator deals with the situation that we have
heteroskedasticity (a diagonal $\Sigma$) of unknown form.  When we
have serial correlation of unknown form (a non-diagonal $\Sigma$), we
can estimate the variance-covariance matrix by a heteroskedasticity
and autocorrelation consistent, or HAC, estimator.  Newey-West
estimator is the most popular HAC estimator.

Given a time series data set, suppose we are interested in estimating
the mean vector (suppose we have more than one variable) and its
variance.  We know that given IID data, we can apply central limit
theorem: sample mean is a consistent estimator of the population mean
and it's variance can be calculated since asymptotically the sample
mean conforms to a normal distribution and the variance can be
estimated, relatively easily.  However, in the case of time series
data, autocorrelation usually exists.  We may be concerned the CLT may
not work in this case.

Fortunately, as proved in Hamilton (1994), if $\bf y_t$ is a
covariance-stationary (meaning that the covariance is not a function
of time) vector process, then the sample mean satisfies:

$$\bf \bar y_t \to \mu , $$
$$ {\bf S} = \lim_{T \to \infty} \bf  {T \cdot E[(\bar y_T - \mu)(\bar y_T -\mu)' ]} = \sum_{v=-\infty}^{\infty} \Gamma_v . $$
where $\bf \Gamma_v$ is the variance-covariance matrix for $\bf y_t$ and $\bf y_{t-v}$.

The first one says for a covariance-stationary vector process, the law
of large numbers still holds.  The second one is used to calculate the
standard error.

If the data were generated by a vector MA(q) process, then

$$ {\bf S} = \sum_{v=-q}^{q} \Gamma_v . $$

A natural estimate is

$$ \bf \hat S = \hat \Gamma_0 + \sum_{v=1}^{q} (\hat \Gamma_v + \hat \Gamma_v' ),$$

where  $$ \bf \hat \Gamma_v = (1/T)  \sum_{t=v+1}^{T} (y_t- \bar y)(y_{t-v} - \bar y). $$

This gives a consistent estimate of $\bf S$; however, it sometimes is
not positive semidefinite.

Newey-West (1987) suggested putting in a weight:

$$ {\bf \hat S = \hat \Gamma_0} + \sum_{v=1}^{q} {(1- \frac{v}{q+1})} (\bf \hat \Gamma_v + \hat \Gamma_v' ), $$
where $q$ is from the MA($q$) process.


Consider a linear regression model:
$$ y_t={ \bf x_t' \beta} + u_t $$

Suppose we have the OLS estimator $\bf b_T$, then
$$ \sqrt{T} ({\bf b_t - \beta}) = [(1/T) {\sum_{t=1}^T \bf x_t
  x_t'}]^{-1} [({\sqrt{T}}) {\sum_{t=1}^{T} \bf x_t u_t'}] $$

The first term converges in probability to some constant.  The second
term is the sample mean of the vector $\bf x_t u_t$.

Under general conditions,

$$ \sqrt{T} ({\bf b_t - \beta}) \rightarrow^L N(0, Q^{-1}SQ^{-1}) $$

where $S$ can be estimated by
$$ {\bf \hat S_T = \hat \Gamma_{0T}} + \sum_{v=1}^{q} {(1- \frac{v}{q+1})} (\bf \hat \Gamma_{v,T} + \hat \Gamma_{v,T}' ), $$
where
$$ \hat \Gamma_{v,T}'= (1/T) \sum_{t=v+1}^T (x_t \hat u_{t, T} \hat u_{t-v, T} x_{t-v}'), $$
where $\hat u_{t,T}$ is the OLS residual for data $t$ in a sample of size $T$.

Overall, the variance of $\bf b_T$ is approximated by

$$\hat \Sigma_{NW} = [\sum_{t=1}^T x_t x_t'] [ \sum_{t=1}^T \hat u_t^2 x_t x_t' +  \sum_{v=1}^{q} {(1- \frac{v}{q+1})} \sum_{t=v+1}^T (x_t \hat u_{t, T} \hat u_{t-v, T} x_{t-v}' + x_{t-v} \hat u_{t-v, T} \hat u_{t, T} x_{t}') ] [\sum_{t=1}^T x_t x_t']^{-1} $$


This estimation obviously depends on the selection of $q$, the lag
length beyond which we are willing to assume that the autocorrelation
of $x_t u_t$ and $x_{t-v} u_{t-v}$ is essentially zero.  The rule of
thumb for the selection of $q$ is $0.75 \cdot T^{\frac{1}{3}}$.
Newey-West (1994) has suggested a way to automatically select the
bandwidth $q$.  Here we omitted the discussion.  Both Stata and R now
also implement Newey-West (1994) estimator, with no need to specify
$q$.

## Introduction

Since heteroscedasticity and serial correlation affect both linear
and nonlinear regression models in the same way, there is no harm
in limiting our attention to the simpler linear case.

$$
\bf y=X\beta+u, \quad {\rm E} (u)=0, \quad {\rm E} (u u')=\Omega,
\label{eqn:linear}
$$
where $\bf \Omega$, the variance-covariance matrix of the error
term, is a positive definite $n \times n$ matrix.  If $\bf \Omega$
is equal to $\sigma^2 \bf I$, then it is just the linear
regression model without heteroscedasticity and serial
correlation. If $\bf \Omega$ is diagonal with nonconstant diagonal
elements, then the error terms are still uncorrelated, but there
is heteroscedasticity.  If $\bf \Omega$ is not diagonal, then
$u_i$ and $u_j$ are correlated.  In next section, we obtain an
efficient estimator for the vector $\beta$ by transforming the
regression so that it satisfies the conditions of Gauss-Markov
Theorem.  This efficient estimator is called the Generalized Least
Squares, or GLS, estimator.

## The GLS Estimator

Since $\bf \Omega$, the variance-covariance matrix of the error
term, is a positive definite $n \times n$ matrix, there always
exist full-rank $n \times n$ matrices (usually triangular) $\bf
\Psi$ such that
$$
\bf \Omega^{-1} =\Psi \Psi'.
$$

Premultiplying (\ref{eqn:linear}) by $\bf \Psi'$ gives
$$
\bf \Psi'y=\Psi'X\beta+\Psi'u. \label{eqn:linear2}
$$

The OLS estimator from regression (\ref{eqn:linear2}) is
$$
\bf \hat \beta_{GLS}=(X'\Psi \Psi' X)^{-1}X'\Psi \Psi'
y=(X'\Omega^{-1} X)^{-1}X'\Omega^{-1} y
$$

The transformed error term has an identity variance-covariance
matrix:
$$
\rm E \bf (\Psi' u u' \Psi)=\Psi' {\rm E} (u u') \Psi= \Psi'
\Omega \Psi=I
$$

Since the transformed model satisfies OLS assumptions, we have

$$
{\rm Var} \bf (\hat \beta_{GLS})= \bf  (X' \Psi \Psi'X)^{-1}\\
= \bf  (X' \Omega X)^{-1}
$$

## Weighted Least Squares

It is easy to obtain GLS estimates when the error terms are
heteroscedastic but uncorrelated, which means $\bf \Omega$ is
diagonal.  Let $\omega_t^2$ denote the $t$th diagonal element of
$\bf \Omega$.  Then $\bf \Psi$ can be chosen as the diagonal
matrix with $t$th diagonal element $\omega_t^{-1}$.  For a typical
observation, regression can be written as
$$
\omega_t^{-1}y_t=\omega_t^{-1} {\bf X_t \beta}+ \omega_t^{-1} u_t.
\label{eqn:wls}
$$
This is called weighted least squares, or WLS.  The weight given
to each observation is $\omega_t^{-1}$.  Observations of which
variance of the error term is large are given low weights, and
observations for which it is small are given high weights.
\subsection{Feasible Generalized Least Squares}

In many cases it is reasonable to suppose that $\bf \Omega$ depends in a known way on a vector of unknown parameters $\bf \gamma$.  If so, it may be possible to estimate $\mathbf{\gamma}$ consistently, so as to obtain $\bf \Omega (\hat \gamma)$.  This type of procedure is called feasible generalized least squares, or feasible GLS.  But we'll
have to specify the error term as some function of some known
variables.



# Endogeneity

When we discuss the linear model we assume that the regressors are
exogenous, meaning that they are independent of or uncorrelated with
the error term.  However, there could be reasons to believe that some
regressors are correlated with the error term.  In that case we call
those regressors endogenous.


Under the classical assumptions OLS estimators are unbiased and
consistent.  One key assumption is that the regressors have to be
uncorrelated with the error term.  If this condition does not hold,
OLS estimators are biased and inconsistent.

When one independent variable does not satisfy this condition, we say
this variable is endogenous.  When one variable is endogenous, the
estimates of other coefficients will also be biased (or inconsistent).

The most popular cure for endogeneity is to use instrumental variables.

## Instrumental Variables (IV)

The basic idea of IV is to use an exogenous variable (or exogenous variables) which is correlated with the endogenous independent variable to as an "instrument" for the endogenous variable.

Suppose the linear regression model
$$
\bf y=X\beta+u, \quad {\rm E} (u u')=\sigma^2 I, \label{eqn:iv}
$$
 at least one of the explanatory variables in the $n \times k$
matrix $\bf X$ is assumed not to be predetermined with respect to the
error terms, or say, endogenous.

Suppose we have a set of  variables $\bf Z$, an $n \times l$
matrix of instruments , which satisfies the moment
condition
$$
\bf Z'(y-X\beta)=0.
$$
That is, $\bf Z$ is uncorrelated with the error term.

Here is what we do for two-stage least squares (2sls):

Stage 1:  Regress each of the variables in the $\bf X$ matrix on
$\bf Z$ to obtain a matrix of fitted values $\bf \hat X$,

$$
\bf \hat X=Z(Z'Z)^{-1}Z'X=P_ZX
$$

This is essentially to get the part of $\bf Z$ that is correlated with $\bf X$.  Or to say, to project $\bf X$ on to $\bf Z$.

Stage 2:  Regress $\bf y$ on $\bf \hat X$ to obtain the estimated
$\bf \beta$

$$
\bf  \hat \beta_{2sls}=(\hat X' \hat X)^{-1}(\hat X'
y)=(X'P_ZX)^{-1}(X'P_Zy)=\hat \beta_{IV}
$$

Standard errors:

$$
Var \bf [ \hat \beta_{2sls}]= \hat \sigma^2 (\hat X' \hat X)^{-1}= \hat
\sigma^2 (X'P_ZX)^{-1}
$$
where $\hat \sigma^2 ={\bf \hat u' \hat u} / N$.

Note that $\bf \hat u = y- X \hat \beta_{2sls}$.

If we do it manually by two steps, the second step will report a wrong
standard error.  That is because the second stage regression will
report standard errors based on $\bf \hat u = y- \hat X \hat
\beta_{2sls}$.  Therefore, it's always recommanded to ask the
statistical program to do a 2sls for you, since presumably that will
give you correct standard errors.

Geometry Illustration:

Suppose the simplest case: $y = \beta_0 + \beta_ x + u$, where $x$
can be decomposed into $x_1$, which is exogenous and $x_2$, which
is endogenous. Therefore $x_2$ is parallel to $u$ and $x_1$
perpendicular to $u$.  Suppose $z$ is a vector that is
perpendicular to $x_2$ or $u$, but not perpendicular to $x_1$.
Then $z$ can be an instrument for $x$.  The way instrumental
variable works: Regress $x$ on $z$, suppose $\hat x_1$ is the
projection.  Regress $y$ on $z$, $\hat y_2$ be the projection.
Then the result of $\beta_2 =  \hat y_2 / \hat x_1$ is the same as
$\beta_1= \hat y_1 / x_1$ (since the two triangles are similar).
Here $\hat y_1$ is the projection of $y$ on $x_1$, which is
hypothetical since we have no way to decompose $x$ into $x_1$ and
$x_2$; otherwise, we would not need instrumental variables.

```{r}
## DGP: data$y <- data$x + data$z + data$u
library(sem)

set.seed(66)
nobs=10000
nDim = 3
sdxx = 1
sdww=1
sdzz=1

## here we have three variables x,z,w.
## z is the omitted variable,x and z are correlated,  w is the instrument, which is correlated with x, but not z.  u is indepent of everything else.
crxz=.6
crzw=0
crxw=.8

covarMat = matrix( c(sdxx^2, crxz^2, crxw^2, crxz^2, sdzz^2, crzw^2,  crxw^2, crzw^2, sdww^2 ) , nrow=nDim , ncol=nDim )
covarMat
data  = data.frame(mvrnorm(n=nobs, mu=rep(0,nDim), Sigma=covarMat ))
names(data) <- c('x','z','w')
data$u <- rnorm(nobs,0,1)
# dgp
data$y <- data$x +  data$z + data$u

lm <- lm(y~x, data=data)
lm.full <- lm(y~ x + z, data=data)
tsls.model <- tsls(y ~ x , ~ w , data=data)
# lm is biased
summary(lm)
# lm.full is good
summary(lm.full)
# tsls is good.
summary(tsls.model)

```


## Control Function Approach

A second way to do an IV regression is also two-step approach: Regress
$\bf X$ (endogenous) on $\bf Z$, get the residual: $\bf \hat
v=X-Z(Z'Z)^{-1}Z'X$, then regress $y$ on $\bf X$ and $\hat v$ to get
$\hat \beta_{IV}$.

The difference between this approach and the 2sls approach is that in
2sls we regress $y$ on $\bf \hat X$; in the control function approach,
we regress $y$ on $\bf  X$ and $\hat v$.  They should both give you
the same coefficient estimates.  There are advantages of using the
control function approach.

An example to show how to do 2sls manually, or using control function approach.

```{r}
## DGP: data$y <- data$x + data$z + data$u

lm1 <- lm(y~x, data=data)
lm2 <- lm(x~w, data=data)
tsls.manual <- lm(data$y ~ lm2$fitted.values)
summary(tsls.manual)

# control function approach
tsls.control <- lm(data$y ~ data$x + lm2$residual)
summary(tsls.control)
```

This approach can be used to do a simple endogeneity test.  First, you
can do a simple test of endogeneity of $\bf X$.  For example:


reg x_endog x* z*
predict v_x, resid
reg y x_endog x* v_x
test v_x


Obviously, this test is based on $\bf Z$ being exogenous.

Secondly, it works for some non-linear models, such as logit, probit,
poisson, or any other glm models.  That is, if you have an endogenous
variable in a glm model, you can regress that endogenous variable on
instruments, get the residual, then run the glm model with the
original regressors, plus the residual from the first stage.


## Durbin-Wu-Hausman Test

### Idea

In econometric modeling, there are often questions on endogeneity.  Do
we know how to test whether an independent variable is endogenous
statistically?  The answer is: sort of, but not really.  We cannot do
endogeneity test without a valid instrument.  Therefore, we have to
have strong argument for a valid instrument first before we can do
endogeneity test.


With endogenous variables on the right-hand side of the equation, we
need to use instrumental variable (IV) regression for consistent
estimation.  However, with IV regression, we lose efficiency: the
asymptotic variance of the IV estimator is larger, and can be much
larger than the OLS estimator.  Therefore, we gain consistency, but
lose efficiency, by using IV estimator when there is an endogeneity
problem.

Now we have a familiar scenario (if you are familiar with Hausman
test for fixed effect and random effect estimator for panel data):
Suppose we have the null hypothesis as the regressor being exogenous.
We have an efficient estimator under null hypothesis yet inconsistent
under alternative hypothesis (OLS estimator). We also have a
consistent estimator under both null and alternative (IV estimator).

Similar to panel data setting, we have the Hausman test statistic as:

$$ H = (\hat \beta_c - \hat \beta_e)' D^{-} (\hat \beta_c - \hat
\beta_e) $$

where $D={\rm Var} [\hat \beta_c] - {\rm Var} [\hat \beta_e]$, $^-$ is
the generalized inverse, $\hat \beta_c$ is the consistent estimator (in
this case the IV estimator) and $\hat \beta_e$ is the efficient
estimator (in this case OLS estimator).

$H$ conforms to $\chi^2_k$ asymptotically, where $k$ is the number of endogenous
variables.

This test is to compare the IV estimator and the OLS estimator: if
it's close, then OLS estimator is fine (fail to reject null that OLS
is consistent, or say the variable is exogenous).  If it's large, then
IV estimator is needed, although we lose some efficiency.  This test
is  based on the assumption that the instruments are exogenous.
If that is in question, then it's pointless to do the test, since the
IV estimator cannot guarantee consistency either.



### Implementation in Stata

In Stata, there are different ways to do it:


Do a regular Hausman test:

    ivreg y x1 (x2=x3 x4)
    estimates store iv
    reg y x1 x2
    hausman iv ., constant sigmamore

Or, simply use  ivendog.



## Identification

Identification in a regression equation means that all parameters can
be uniquely estimated.  A necessary condition of that is to have at
least as many instruments as the number of endogenous variables.  That
is, $l \ge k$ in our example above.  If $l=k$ we have
exact-identification.  If $l>k$, we have over-identification.

Over-identification generates more efficient estimates, given the
assumption of instruments being exogenous.  The other advantage of
over-identification is that over-identification tests can be done to
test the adequacy of instruments.

Under the null hypothesis that all the instruments are uncorrelated
with the error term, an LM statistic  $N \times R^2$ conforms to
$\chi^2 (r)$ distribution, $r=l-k$, the number of excess instruments,
 or say, the number of excluded restrictions.  If we reject the null,
 then we should be concerned about the exogeneity of the whole set of
 the instruments.  This test is called Sargan's test in IV context, and
 (Hansen's) J test in GMM context.

 What the J test or Sargan's test does is to test the whole set of
 instruments being exogenous or not.  There is another test for
 testing exogeneity for a subset of instruments.  It's call a C test
 or a difference-in-Sargan test.  The idea is to calculate the
 difference between two Sargan's statistics (or Hansen's J in GMM
 setting); one is with the whole set of instruments, the other one
 without the suspected instruments.  The null is that the suspect
 instruments are exogenous; or orthogonal to the error term.
 Obviously to conduct the C test, we'll have to have at least one
 extra instrument more than the number of endogenous variables.

 To understand it better, we look at how to implement Sargan's test
 manually: For the 2SLS estimator, the test statistic is Sargan's
 statistic, typically calculated as $N \times R^2$ from a regression of
 the IV residuals on the full set of instruments.


    . ivregress 2sls rent pcturban (hsngval = faminc i.region)
    . estat overid

      Tests of overidentifying restrictions:

      Sargan (score) chi2(3) =  11.2877  (p = 0.0103)
      Basmann chi2(3)        =  12.8294  (p = 0.0050)

    . predict res, residual

    . reg res pcturban faminc i.region

    . disp e(N)*e(r2)
    11.287665




### Implementation in Stata

In Stata, there are different ways to do over-identification test,
ivreg2 reports a comprehensive set of tests; overid command does the
over-identification test after the ivreg command.

  ivreg2 with   gmm option returns J test; it reports
Sargan's test without this option.

  ivreg2 also reports C test statistic, with ortho().  If the C test rejects the null, and J test without the suspect instruments fail to reject null, then the suspect instruments are indeed the ones are not exogenous.



## Weak Instruments

### Problem with the cure

An instrument needs to satisfy to criteria: orthogonality and
relevance.  We need instruments to be orthogonal to the error term.
We can verify the orthogonality condition  by Sargan's test if there are extra
instruments.

It turns out instrument relevance is important too: if instruments are
weak, then the regular large sample properties of IV or GMM estimators
do not hold any more.  The estimators are inconsistent or biased.

To see the problem, suppose

$$
\bf y=X\beta+u, \quad {\rm E} (u u')=\sigma_u^2 I, \label{eqn:wi1}
$$

$$
\bf X=Z\Pi+v, \quad {\rm E} (v v')=\sigma_v^2 I, \label{eqn:wi2}
$$

and
$$
{\rm E}(\bf Z u )=0. \label{eqn:zu}
$$

We can see here $\bf Z$ is exogenous.  However, the model does not say
anything about relevance.  To illustrate the problem caused by weak
instrument, suppose we have only one endogenous variable and one
instrument.

$$
\hat \beta_{2sls}=\frac{\bf Z' y}{\bf Z' X} = \frac{\bf Z'(X \beta +
  u)}{\bf Z'
  X}= \beta + \frac{\bf Z' u}{\bf Z' X} . \label{eqn:wk3}
$$

If $\bf Z$ is irrelevant, or, $\Pi=0$, then

$$
\hat \beta_{2sls}- \beta=\frac{\bf Z' u}{\bf Z' v} =\frac{ \frac{1}{\sqrt n}
\sum_{i=1}^N Z_i u_i}{\frac{1}{\sqrt n} \sum_{i=1}^N Z_i v_i}
\xrightarrow{d} \frac{z_u}{z_v} ,
$$

where

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
z_u \\z_v
\end{bmatrix}
\sim N(0, \begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_u^2 \quad \sigma_{uv} \\  \sigma_{uv} \quad \sigma_v^2
\end{bmatrix}).
$$

Therefore, if $\bf Z$ is irrelavent, $\beta_{2sls}$ is inconsistent.
Also, the distribution of the bias is Cauchy-like (the ratio of
correlated normals).

This is a case where the cure might be worse than the disease itself:
the bias can be big comparing to the bias an OLS estimate suffers.

### Weak Instrument Tests

There are a variety of weak-instruments tests proposed.  Most of them
are based on so-called weak-instruments asymptotics and a new
parameter called "concentration parameter" $\mu^2 = \Pi' Z' Z \Pi
/ \sigma_v^2$.  Sample size only enters the distribution through
$\mu^2$.

With weak-instruments asymptotics, IV estimators are no longer
consistent, and they are not normal asymptotically.  Most test
statistics (J test, etc.) do not have normal or $\chi^2$ distributions
anymore.

Now I list the following tests in the order of recommended level by
James Stock:

1. Moreira (2003) conditional likelihood ratio test (CLR).


  Advantages of this test:
      a.  Uniformly most powerful tests among valid tests.
      b.  Implemented in Stata as condivereg.

Disadvantages:

   a.  Complicated.  Only developed so far for one endogenous
  variable case.

2.  Stock-Yogo bias method and size method.

Stock and Yogo (2005) provide critical values for both methods: one is
to control the size of bias, the other one is to control the size of a
Wald test of $\beta=\beta_0$.  Bias method is more frequently used.
In the case of multiple endogenous variables, the Craigg-Donald
statistics is used to compare with the critical values.  It is
implemented in Stata as part of the {\em ivreg2} command, but it's
only available for the situation there are at least two excluded
variables (meaning the number of instruments minus the number of
endogenous variables).

2.   Anderson-Rubin confidence intervals.

In the model of

$$
\bf y=X\beta+u, \quad {\rm E} (u u')=\sigma_u^2 I,
$$

$$
\bf X=Z\Pi+v, \quad {\rm E} (v v')=\sigma_v^2 I,
$$

The null hypothesis $H_0: \beta=\beta_0$.  Anderson-Rubin statistic
is the F statistic in the regression of $y-X \beta_0$ on $Z$, the F
test on $\Pi$ being zero:


$$
AR(\beta_0)= \frac{(y-X\beta_0)' P_Z (y-X\beta_0)/k}{(y-X\beta_0)' M_Z
  (y-X\beta_0)/(N-k)}
$$

The idea of AR confidence interval is to construct an interval for all
possible values of $\beta$ to fail to reject $\Pi=0$.

3.  First-stage F test.

The rule of thumb for first-stage F test is $F>10$ for a single
instrument case, the more instruments, the higher it gets.

4.   Kleibergen's LM test.

This test is dominated by the CLR test, thus no longer the optimal
test to use.

5.   First-stage $R^2$, or partial $R^2$, etc., are not recommended.


## When is endogeneity a problem and what can we say from an IV regression

Let's consider a model of housing price on no. of rooms
and square footage.

$$ P = \alpha R + \beta F + \epsilon $$

Should square footage really be there?  We are not interested in,
given square footage, how much money we need to pay for an additional
room.  We are generally interested in how much money we need to pay
for an additional footage.  However, if we do not include footage,
then we "sort of" have endogeneity problem due to omitted variable.

Another example would be education's impact on wage.  Say IQ is an
omitted variable.  Do we want to say something about education's
impact on wage controlling on IQ, or not?

So it depends on what questions to ask.  If I am a builder and ask
what an extra bedroom on the already built house would bring to me, I
need to control for footage.  If I am generally asking what an extra
bedroom would cost, then I am implying what that bedroom and
associated footage would cost me.  In that case, without controlling
for footage is not a problem, since the question is:  what an
additional bedroom (AND the associated average square footage) would
cost me.

In the wage and education example, if I am asking: what's the effect
of education on wage?  I implicitly ask what would be my pay raise if
I go to college (given IQ, of course), for example.  Then we are
concerned that this model of
$$ wage= \alpha edu + \epsilon $$
will generate biased estimate of $\alpha$, because we are not
controlling for IQ.  But if I am an employer and interested in hiring
a person, what would I have to pay extra to hire a collage graduate
vs. a high school graduate?  Then I don't have to include that IQ
variable, because implicitly I am asking: what extra I need to pay for
that college graduate who comes with a higher IQ, and everything else
that is associated with higher education.

In addition, what an IV regression really gives us is part of the causal
inference of $X$ (suspected to be endogenous) on $y$, namely the part
induced by $Z$.  For example, we are interested in the relationship
between colleage education and wage.  If we use distance to college as
an instrument, then our inference is the effect of college education
from those who decide to go because of nearbyness of the college.

# General Method of Moments (GMM)

## The Method of Moments (MOM)

A population moment $\gamma$ can be defined as the expectation of
some continuous function $g$ of a random variable $x$:
$$
\gamma={\mathrm{E}} [g(x)]
$$

On the other hand, a sample moment is the sample version of the
population moment in a particular sample:
$$
\hat \gamma=\frac{1}{n} \sum [g(x)]
$$

\section{OLS as a moment problem}

Consider the simple linear regression
$$
\bf y=X\beta+u, \quad u \sim IID(0, \sigma^2).
$$

If the model is correctly specified, then
$$
\rm E (\bf X'u)=0.
$$

The MOM principle suggests that we replace the left-hand side with
its sample analog $\frac{1}{n} \bf X'(y-X\beta)$.

Since we know that the true $\bf \beta$ sets the population moment
equal to zero in expectation, it seems reasonable to assume that a
good choice of $\bf \hat \beta$ would be one that sets the sample
moment to zero.  The MOM procedure suggests an estimate of $\bf
\beta$ that solves
$$
\frac{1}{n} \bf X'(y-X \hat \beta)=0.
$$

The MOM estimator is
$$
\bf \hat \beta=(X'X)^{-1}X'y,
$$
which is the same as the OLS estimator.

## IV as a moment problem
Consider the simple linear regression
$$
\bf y=X\beta+u, \quad u \sim IID(0, \sigma^2).
$$

If the model is mis-specified, then
$$
\rm E (\bf X'u)\neq 0.
$$

We have to find an instrumental variable $\bf Z$ which is
$$
\rm E (\bf Z'u)= 0.
$$
Or,
$$
\rm E (\bf Z'(y-X\beta))= 0.
$$

The sample analogy of this is
$$
\frac{1}{n} \bf Z'(y-X \hat \beta)=0.
$$

That gives us the IV estimator
$$
\bf \hat \beta=(Z'X)^{-1}Z'y.
$$

## The Generalized Method of Moments

The expectation ${\rm E}(Y^r)$ for any $r=1,2, \dots$ is called the
$r^{th}$ (raw) moment of $Y$.  The expectation ${\rm E} [(Y-{\rm
  E}(Y))^r]$ is called the $r^{th}$ centered moment of $Y$.

The mean is the first raw moment.

The variance is the second centered moment.

The third centered moment measures the skewness of the
distribution.

The fourth centered moment measures the kurtosis of the
distribution.  Interpreted as a measure of "fatness of tails".

The standardized kurtosis is

$$
k = \frac{E[(Y-E(Y))^4]}{E[(Y-E(Y))^2]^2}.
$$

For a normal distribution, $k=3.$

For a $t$ distribution with $v \geq 5$ degrees of freedom,
$k=3+6/(v-4) > 4.$  i.e., the $t$ distribution has fatter tails
than a normal distribution.

The distribution function of a random variable captures all
information about the random variable.  It can be shown using all
moments also captures all information.

This distinction underlies the relative strengths and weaknesses
of ML and GMM.

## GMM

The statistical model takes the general form
$$
E[m(Y_i; \theta_0)]=0
$$
where
\begin{itemize}
\item $Y_1, \cdots, Y_2$ are random variables from which the
sample $y_1, \cdots, y_n$ is drawn, \item $m(Y, \theta)$ is a
function specifying the model, \item $\theta_0$ is the "true
value" of the parameter.
\end{itemize}

$E[m(Y_i; \theta_0)]=0$ are called the population moment
conditions.\\

Two ideas behind GMM:

1.  Replace the population mean $E[.]$ with the sample mean
  calculated from the observed sample $y_1, \cdots, y_n$.

2.  Since  $E[m(Y_i; \theta_0)]=0$, choose $\hat \theta_{GMM}$ to make
  $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}m(y_i; \hat \theta_{GMM})$ as close to
  zero as possible.


Define the notation

$$
\bar m(\theta)=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n m(y_i; \theta).
$$

$\hat \theta_{GMM}$ is chosen to make $\bar m(\theta)'\bar
m(\theta)$ as close to
zero as possible.\\

More generally, $\hat \theta_{GMM}$ is chosen to minimize $\bar
m(\theta)'W \bar m(\theta)$ for some weighting matrix $W$.

### An example

Let's see an example with GMM, using the same simulated data as before.  We have the same siguation as before, $X$ is endogenous.  We are doing GMM version of 2sls.

Here I use R's "gmm" library which makes things easy.  It expects two arguments: "g" and "x", which correponds to $u$ and $W$ here.   The moment condition is $E(W u) = 0$ in this example.  $W$ is the intrument, and $u$ is the residual from regressing $y$ on endogenous $X$.


```{r}
## DGP: data$y <- data$x + data$z + data$u
library(gmm)

set.seed(66)
nobs=10000
nDim = 3
sdxx = 1
sdww=1
sdzz=1

## here we have three variables x,z,w.
## z is the omitted variable,x and z are correlated,  w is the instrument, which
## is correlated with x, but not z.  u is indepent of everything else.
crxz=.6
crzw=0
crxw=.8

covarMat = matrix( c(sdxx^2, crxz^2, crxw^2, crxz^2, sdzz^2, crzw^2,  crxw^2, crzw^2, sdww^2 ) , nrow=nDim , ncol=nDim )
covarMat
data  = data.frame(mvrnorm(n=nobs, mu=rep(0,nDim), Sigma=covarMat ))
names(data) <- c('x','z','w')
data$u <- rnorm(nobs,0,1)
# dgp
data$y <- data$x +  data$z + data$u

gmm.fit = gmm(data$y~data$x, data$w)
summary(gmm.fit)

# It returns the same estimates as the 2sls results.
tsls.model <- tsls(y ~ x , ~ w , data=data)
summary(tsls.model)

```

In OLS case, it would be $E(X u) = 0$.


```{r}
gmm.ols = gmm(data$y~data$x, data$x)
summary(gmm.ols)

# It returns the same estimates as the OLS results.
ols <- lm(y ~ x, data=data)
summary(ols)

```


## A few concepts of conditioning

### Independence

If $X$ and $Y$ are independent then
$$
f(x,y)=f(x)f(y)
$$
and hence
$$
f(y|x)=f(y).
$$

If $X$ and $Y$ are independent then
$$
E[g(X)h(Y)]=E[g(X)]\cdot E[h(Y)]
$$
and hence
$$
Cov[g(X),h(Y)]=0.
$$
i.e. all functions of $X$ and $Y$ are uncorrelated.

###  Law of Iterated Expectations
$$
E[Y]=E[E(Y|X)].
$$

### Dependence Concepts

 $X$, $Y$ independent:
$$
Cov[g(X),h(Y)]=0
$$

$X$, $Y$ uncorrelated:
$$
Cov[X,Y]=0
$$


$E[Y|X]=0$:

$$
Cov[g(X),Y]=0
$$


### Regression

A regression model is a model of $E[Y_i|X_i]$.  For example,
$$
Y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1X_i+u_i
$$
where $E[u_i|X_i]=0$.\\

### GMM regression

The regression model
$$
Y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1X_i+u_i, \quad E[u_i|X_i]=0
$$
implies the moment condition
$$
E[u_i]=0 \quad  \mbox{and} \quad  E[X_i u_i]=0
$$

That is,
$$
E[Y_i-\beta_0-\beta_1X_i]=0
$$
$$
E[X_i(Y_i-\beta_0-\beta_1X_i)]=0
$$

The sample moment conditions are
$$
\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}{n}(y_i-\hat \beta_0-\hat \beta_1x_i)=0
$$
$$
\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}{n}x_i(y_i-\hat \beta_0-\hat \beta_1x_i)=0
$$

These are just normal equations for OLS.

A characteristic of GMM:  the specification of the model generates
the estimator.  i.e. only $E[Y_i|X_i]=\beta_0+\beta_1 X_i$ is
assumed.

Note there are no assumptions that $u_i$ is homoscedastic, not
autocorrelated or normally distributed.  These properties affect
the statistical properties of the GMM estimator, not its
definition.


# Censored, truncated or selected data

## Compare three different cases


A sample is truncated if some observations are systematically excluded
from the sample.  For example, suppose we are interested in
relationship between people's income($y$) and education($x$).  If we
have observations of both $y$ and $x$ only for people whose income is
above \$20,000 per year, then we have a truncated sample.  A sample is
censored if no observations have been systematically excluded but some
of information contained in them has been suppressed.  In other words,
in a truncated sample, you don't have observations which have been
truncated; while in a censored sample, you do have observations but
you don't have full information.  The idea of "censoring" is that some
data above or below a threshold are mis-reported at the threshold.  If
we use the same example of people's income, if we don't observe
people's income ($y$) and education($x$) with income lower than
\$20,000 per year, then we have a truncated sample.  If we have
observations of $x$ for people whose income above AND below that
limit, but no information on exactly how much their income is for
those whose income below the limit (only thing we know is that it's
lower than \$20,000 per year), then we have a censored sample.



The problem of sample selection arises when no observations have been
systematically excluded but some information has been suppressed, just
like censoring.  However, in sample selection problems, we have
information on how the "selection" happens.  In censoring, usually a
constant "threshold" is set.  Observations on dependent variable for
those above (or below) that criteria are missing. Using the income
example again, the threshold is set to be \$20,000, we have no
information on exactly how much their income is for those whose income
below the limit (only thing we know is that it's lower than \$20,000
per year).  When we have a third variable that determines the
censoring situation, then we call it sample selection.  For example,
we have observed only union member's information on income, but we
observe information on education for everybody, including union
members or non-members.  In this example, union membership is an
additional variable that "selects" the sample which are involved in
the estimation of effect of education on income.




## An illustration for truncated or censored data

Consider the model
$$
y_t^0=\beta_1 +\beta_2 x_t +u_t, \ u_t \sim NID(0, \sigma^2),
$$
where $y_t^0$ is a latent variable.  We actually observe $y_t$, which
differs from $y_t^0$ , because it's either truncated or censored.

Suppose that censorship or truncation occurs whenever $y_t^0$ is less
than 0.  Clearly, the larger the error term $u_t$, the larger is
$y_t^0$ and thus the greater must be the probability that $y_t^0 \geq
0$.  This probability also depends on $x_t$.  So for the sample we
observe, $u_t$ does not have conditional mean 0 and is not
uncorrelated with $x_t$.  OLS using truncated or censored samples (OLS
of $y_t$ on $x_t$) yields biased and inconsistent estimators.
Normally we would like to draw inference on the population which is
represented by the full sample.  Shown in figure 1, ideally we would
have the OLS regression line (if we had the full sample), which is
very close to the "true" regression line (which is the mechnism
generates the data).  We would have the "OLS censored sample" line
if we run OLS on the censored sample; we would have "OLS truncated
sample" if we run OLS on the truncated sample.  It shows that both of
them are severely biased from the "true" regression line.

Here is a graph to illustrate from Davidson and MacKinnon.

![Effects of truncation and censoring from Davidson and MacKinnon](figures/davidson.jpg)

## Truncated Models

For truncated data, a consistent estimator comes from maximum
likelihood estimator (MLE).  If we assume the error terms in the
latent variable model has a known distribution, then MLE estimator can
be applied.  The most popular choice is Gaussian.
\begin{eqnarray}
\mbox{Pr}(y_t^0 \geq 0) & = & \mbox{Pr} ({\bf X}_t \beta +u_t \geq
0) \nonumber \\
& = & 1- \mbox{Pr} (u_t/\sigma < - {{\bf X}_t \beta} / \sigma)
\nonumber \\
 & = & 1- \Phi (-{{\bf X}_t \beta} / \sigma)=\Phi ({{\bf X}_t \beta} / \sigma)
\end{eqnarray}

The density of $y_t$ is proportional to the density of $y_t^0$
when $y_t^0 \geq 0$ and $y_t$ is observed.  It is 0 elsewhere. The
factor of proportionality, which is needed to ensure that the
density integrates to unity, is the inverse of the probability
that $y_t^0 \geq 0$.  The density of $y_t$ can be written as
$$
\frac{\sigma^{-1} \phi ((y_t - {\bf X}_t \beta)/\sigma)}{\Phi
({\bf X}_t \beta / \sigma)}
$$

This implies the log-likelihood function,
$$
\ell ({\bf y, \beta}, \sigma)=- \frac{n}{2} \log(2 \pi) -n
\log(\sigma) - \frac{1}{2 \sigma^2} \sum_{t=1}^n(y_t-{\bf X}_t
\beta)^2 - \sum_{t=1}^n \log \Phi ({\bf X}_t \beta / \sigma).
$$

This can be estimated by MLE.  In Stata, truncreg is the command to do
truncated regression model.

## Censored Models

The most popular censored model is Tobit model.
\begin{eqnarray}
y_t^0 & = & {\bf X}_t +u_t, \quad u_t \sim NID(0, \sigma^2) \nonumber \\
y_t & = & y_t^0 \ \mbox{if} \ y_t^0 > 0; \ y_t=0 \
\mbox{otherwise}.
\end{eqnarray}

We see that
\begin{eqnarray}
\mbox{Pr}(y_t= 0) & = & \mbox{Pr} (y_t^0 \leq 0) = \mbox{Pr} ({\bf
X}_t \beta +u_t \leq 0) \nonumber \\
& = & \mbox{Pr} (u_t/\sigma < - {{\bf X}_t \beta} / \sigma)
\nonumber \\
 & = &  \Phi (-{{\bf X}_t \beta} / \sigma)
\end{eqnarray}

The contribution to the log-likelihood function made by
observations with $y_t=0$ is
$$
\ell_t(y_t, \beta, \sigma) = \log \Phi (-{\bf X}_t \beta/\sigma).
$$

If $y_t$ is positive, the contribution to the log-likelihood is the
logarithm of the density,
$$
\log(\frac{1}{\sigma} \phi ((y_t - {\bf X}_t \beta) / \sigma )).
$$

The log-likelihood function of the tobit model is
$$
\sum_{y_t=0} \log \Phi (-{\bf X}_t \beta/\sigma) + \sum_{y_t>0}
\log(\frac{1}{\sigma} \phi ((y_t - {\bf X}_t \beta)/\sigma )))
$$

This can be estimated by MLE. In Stata, tobit or intreg can be used
for censoring models.

## Sample Selection

The sample selection models differ from censored model in that it
involves a different variable (from $y$ itself) to determine the
censorship (selection).

Suppose that $y_t^0$ and $z_t^0$ are two latent variables,
generated by the bivariate process

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
y_t^0 \\ z_t^0
\end{bmatrix}
=\begin{bmatrix} {\bf X}_t \beta \\ {\bf W}_t \gamma
\end{bmatrix}+
\begin{bmatrix} u_t \\ v_t
\end{bmatrix}, \
\begin{bmatrix} u_t \\ v_t
\end{bmatrix} \sim NID({\bf 0},
\begin{bmatrix} \sigma^2 & \rho  \\ \rho  & 1
\end{bmatrix})
$$

We observe $y_t$ and $z_t$:
$$
 y_t  =  y_t^0 \ \mbox{if} \ z_t^0 > 0;  \ y_t \ \mbox{unobservable otherwise}; \nonumber \\
 z_t  =  1  \ \mbox{if} \ z_t^0 > 0; \ z_t=0 \ \mbox{otherwise}.
$$

There are two types of observations, ones we observe $y_t=y_t^0$
and $z_t=1$, along with both $\bf X_t$ and $\bf W_t$, and ones we
observe only $z_t=0$ and $\bf W_t$.

Each observation contributes to the likelihood function by
$$
I(z_t=0)\mbox{Pr}(z_t=0)+I(z_t=1)\mbox{Pr}(z_t=1)f(y_t^0 | z_t=1),
$$

Under the normality assumption,
$$
u_t=\rho v_t+e_t
$$
where $e_t$ is independent of $v_t \sim N(0,1)$.  A useful fact
about the standard normal distribution is that
$$
{\rm E} (v_t | v_t>-x)=\lambda (x) =\frac{\phi(x)}{\Phi(x)}
$$
and the function $\lambda(x)$ is called the inverse Mills ratio.

The log-likelihood function can be shown to be
$$
\sum_{z_t=0} \log \Phi(-{\bf W}_t \gamma)+\sum_{z_t=1}
\log(\frac{1}{\sigma} \phi ((y_t - {\bf X}_t \beta)/\sigma)) +
\sum_{z_t=1} \log \Phi (\frac{{\bf W}_t \gamma+\rho (y_t-{\bf X}_t
\beta)/\sigma}{(1-\rho^2)^{1/2}})
$$

So this model can be estimated by MLE.

It is also popular to use Heckman's two-step method.

Heckman's method is based on the fact that the original latent
model can be rewritten as
$$
y_t={\bf X}_t \beta + \rho v_t +e_t
$$

Here the error term $u_t$ is divided into two parts, one
perfectly correlated with $v_t$, and one independent of $v_t$.

In the first step, an ordinary probit model is used to obtain
consistent estimates $\hat \gamma$ of the parameters of the
selection equation.

In the second step, the unobserved $v_t$ is replaced by the
selectivity regressor $\frac{\phi({\bf W}_t \hat
\gamma)}{\Phi({\bf W}_t \hat \gamma)}$.

Therefore, the regression becomes
$$
y_t={\bf X}_t \beta + \rho \frac{\phi({\bf W}_t \hat
\gamma)}{\Phi({\bf W}_t \hat \gamma)} + e_t
$$

Or,
$$
y_t={\bf X}_t \beta + \rho \hat \lambda_t + e_t
$$

One thing to note in Heckman model is that in many situations, $\hat \lambda$ is believed to be highly collinear with $\bf X_t$, if $\bf W_t$ is the same as $\bf X_t$.  However, the model can still be estimated due to the nonlinearity of the model.  Nevertheless, it becomes a regular practice to require $\bf W_t$ contains at least one extra variable than $\bf X_t$, which is sometimes called exclusion restriction.  In many situations, $\bf W_t$ contains all $\bf X_t$ variables, and at least one more variable.  The reason to contain all $\bf X_t$ variables is because the selection is "endogenous" in the sense that $y_t$ is a factor in determining selection; this is modeled by including all the $\bf X_t$'s.


In Stata, heckman is the command to do sample selection models.  It
has options to do a Heckman two-step estimation or MLE estimation.
Usually MLE is preferred.

## Switching Regression (Treatment-Effects Model)


There is another situation that is similar to sample selection model:
we observe $y$ for $z=1$ and $z=0$.  In the example of effect of
education on income, we observe both union member's income and
non-member's income.  In this case, we have switching regression model
or treatment-effect model.  The treatment effect model estimates the
effect of an endogenous binary treatment$z_t$ (treatment, program
participation, etc.) on a continuous, fully-observed variable,$y_t$,
conditional on the independent variables $x_t$ and $w_t$.

Suppose $z_t^0$ is a latent variable.

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
y_t \\ z_t^0
\end{bmatrix}
=\begin{bmatrix} {\bf X}_t \beta \\ {\bf W}_t \gamma
\end{bmatrix}+ \delta \begin{bmatrix} {z_t} \\ 0
\end{bmatrix} +
\begin{bmatrix} u_t \\ v_t
\end{bmatrix}, \
\begin{bmatrix} u_t \\ v_t
\end{bmatrix} \sim NID({\bf 0},
\begin{bmatrix} \sigma^2 & \rho  \\ \rho  & 1
\end{bmatrix})
$$

We observe $y_t$ and $z_t$:
\begin{eqnarray}
  z_t  =  1  \ \mbox{if} \ z_t^0 > 0; \ z_t=0 \ \mbox{otherwise}.
\end{eqnarray}

Notice that the only difference between the switching regression and
selection model is that we observe $y_t$ when $z_t=0$ and $z_t=1$.
It's not a selection, but a regime switching.

Both Stata (treatreg) and SAS (qlim) can estimate the switching
regression.  The default is by MLE.


# Discrete and Limited Dependent Variables

## Binary Response Models

### Probit and Logit

Let $P_t$ denote the probability that $y_t=1$ conditional on the
information set $\Omega$, which consists of exogenous and
predetermined variables.  A binary response model serves to model this
conditional expectation.  Since the values are 0 or 1, it is clear
that $P_t$ is also the expectation of $y_t$ conditional on $\Omega_t$:
$$
P_t \equiv \mbox{Pr}(y_t=1 | \Omega_t)=\mbox{E}(y_t | \Omega_t).
$$

Since $0 \le P_t \le 1$, $X_t \hat \beta$ needs to be in this interval
too, $X_t$ is a set of regressors.

We ensure that $0 \le P_t \le 1$ by specifying that
$$
P_t \equiv \mbox{Pr}(y_t=1 | \Omega_t)=F(\bf X_t \beta).
$$
$F(x)$ is a transformation function, which has the same
characteristics as the CDF of a probability distribution.

Two popular choices of $F(x)$ are Gaussian (probit) and Logistic
(logit).

The less familiar logistic function is
$$
\Lambda(x)=\frac{e^x}{1+e^x}
$$

The logit model is most easily derived by assuming that
$$
\log (\frac{P_t}{1-P_t})=\bf X_t \beta
$$
which says the logarithm of the odds (the ratio of the two
probabilities) is equal to $\bf X_t \beta$.  Therefore,
$$
P_t =\frac{\exp({\bf X}_t \beta)}{1+\exp({\bf X}_t
\beta)}=\Lambda({\bf X}_t \beta)
$$

### MLE for binary data
The likelihood for an observation $t$ is the probability that $y_t=1$
if $y_t=1$, or the probability that $y_t=0$ if $y_t=0$.  The logarithm
of the appropriate probability is then the contribution to the
loglikelihood made by observation $t$.  Therefore, if $\bf y$ is an
n-vector with typical element $y_t$, the loglikelihood function for
$\bf y$ can be written as
$$
{\ell}({\bf y, \beta})=\sum_{t=1}^n(y_t \log F({\bf X_t
\beta})+(1-y_t) \log(1- F({\bf X_t \beta}))
$$

For the logit and probit models, this function is globally concave
with respect to $\beta$.  This implies that the first-order
conditions, or likelihood equations, uniquely define the MLE estimator
$\hat \beta$.  These likelihood equations can be written as
$$
\sum_{t=1}^n \frac{(y_t-F({\bf X_t \beta}))F({\bf X_t
\beta})x_{ti}}{F({\bf X_t \beta})(1- F({\bf X_t \beta}))}=0, \
i=1, \dots, k.
$$

Newton's Method can be used to find $\hat \beta$.

## Models for More than Two Discrete Responses

### The Ordered Probit

Ordered Probit can be easily derived from a latent variable model.
$$
y_t^0={\bf X}_t \beta+u_t, \ u_t \sim NID(0,1)
$$

Suppose we observe $y_t$ with three values.

$$
y_t = 0 \quad \mbox{if} \ y_t^0 < \gamma_1; \nonumber \\
y_t = 1 \quad \mbox{if} \ \gamma_1 \leq y_t^0 < \gamma_2; \nonumber \\
y_t = 2 \quad \mbox{if} \ \leq y_t^0 \geq \gamma_1.
$$

Therefore,
$$
\mbox{Pr}(y_t=0) = \mbox{Pr}(y_t^0 < \gamma_1)=\mbox{Pr}({\bf
X}_t \beta < \gamma_1) \nonumber \\
= \mbox{Pr}(u_t < \gamma_1 - {\bf X}_t \beta)=\Phi ( \gamma_1
- {\bf X}_t \beta)
$$

Similarly,
$$
\mbox{Pr}(y_t=2) = \Phi (  {\bf X}_t \beta - \gamma_2)
$$
$$
\mbox{Pr}(y_t=2) = \Phi ( \gamma_2- {\bf X}_t \beta ) - \Phi (
\gamma_1- {\bf X}_t \beta )
$$

These probabilities depend solely on the value of the index function
and on the two threshold parameters.

The loglikelihood function is
$$
\ell (\beta, \gamma_1, \gamma_2) = \sum_{y_t=0} \log(\Phi
(\gamma_1 - {\bf X}_t \beta)) + \sum_{y_t=2} \log(\Phi ( {\bf X}_t
\beta - \gamma_2)) +  \sum_{y_t=1} \log(\Phi ( \gamma_2  - {\bf
X}_t \beta ) -\Phi ( \gamma_1  - {\bf X}_t \beta ))
$$

### The Multinomial Logit

When responses are unordered, the popular choice is multinomial logit.

Suppose there are $J+1$ responses, for $J \geq 1$.

$$
\mbox{Pr}(y_t=l)=\frac{\exp({\bf W}_{tl}
\beta^l)}{\sum_{j=0}^J\exp({\bf W}_{tl} \beta^l)} \quad \mbox{for}
\ l=0, \dots, J.
$$

Here ${\bf W}_{tj}$ is a row vector of length $k_j$ of observations on
variables that belong to the information set of interest, and
$\beta^j$ is a $k_j$-vector of parameters, usually different for each
$j=0, \dots, J.$

# Count data models
## Poisson Model

If the interested variable is a count data variable, it is natural to model it as a Poisson process.  The number of occurance follows a Poisson process:

$$
{\rm Pr} [Y=y]=\frac{e^{-\mu} \mu^y}{y! }
$$

One of Poisson's properties is that it has equal variance as its mean:

$$
{\rm E} [Y]={\rm Var} [Y]=\mu
$$


In a count data model such as Poisson regression model, we are modeling log of the expected counts:

$$
\log ({\rm E}( Y) )=\bf X_i' \beta
$$

The log-likelihood function is
$$
\log L(\beta)= \sum_{i=1}^N {- \exp (X_i' \beta) + y_i X_i' \beta - \ln y_i!}
$$

To maximize it, the first order condition is

$$
\sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - \exp (X_i' \beta) )X_i'=0 \label{first_order}
$$

We can use Newton-Raphson or other optimization algorithms to find the solution for the first order condition.


## QMLE Poisson

#### Model

Note that in equation \ref{first_order}, if $X_i'$ includes a constant, then $(y_i - \exp (X_i' \beta) )$ sums to zero.  If ${\rm E} [y_i|X_i] = \exp (X_i' \beta)$, then the summation on the left-hand side has expectation of zero.  Hence the only specification needed to apply equation \ref{first_order} is the conditional expectation of $Y$ given $X$.  Even the data is not Poisson-distributed, the estimator by equation \ref{first_order} is still consistent.  Therefore, this estimator is called quasi\_ML (QML) Poisson estimator.


Although the QML Poisson estimator is consistent under relatively weak condition, the regular variance estimator for the coefficients are not valid anymore.

If a stronger assumption is made that the data follows a Poisson distribution, then the error term has a variance which equals to the mean of $Y$.  The estimator $\hat \beta_P$ (ML estimator) follows a normal distribution asymptotically with a variance matrix



$$
 {\rm Var}_{ML} [\hat \beta_P] = (\sum_{i=1}^N \mu_i X_i X_i')^{-1}
$$


On the other hand, the variance matrix for the  QML Poisson estimator $\hat \beta_{QML}$ is

$$
 {\rm Var}_{QML} [\hat \beta_P] = (\sum_{i=1}^N \mu_i X_i X_i')^{-1} (\sum_{i=1}^N \omega_i X_i X_i')^{-1} (\sum_{i=1}^N \mu_i X_i X_i')^{-1}
$$

where $\omega_i = {\rm Var} [y_i | X_i]$ is the conditional variance of $y_i$.




### Implementation

Poisson estimation is implemented in almost every statistical package.
However, some of them may not work if you have a continuous dependent
variable.

Stata's implementation of Poisson model: "poisson" and "xtpoisson" do take
continuous dependent variable.  Note that standard errors reported
without any specification in "vce" will be likely downward biased.
Therefore, always use "robust" option at least.  Bootstrapped
standard errors are also preferred.  However, if you intend to use it
as QMLE-Poisson, standard errors need to be adjusted.  Those two
procedures do not adjust for standard errors.  A user-written program
called xtpqml calls for xtpoisson and it calculates robust standard
error which is suggested by Wooldridge (1999).


## Fixed-effect Poisson model

We specify a panel data count model as:
$$
E[y_{it} | \alpha_i, X_{it}]= \alpha_i \exp(X'_{it} \beta) =
\exp(\gamma_i + X'_{it} \beta).
$$


It turns out that for fixed-effect Poisson model, just like in linear
regression case, there is NO incidental parameter problem.  Poisson
MLE is the same for conditional and unconditional likelihood.(See
Cameron and Trivedi, 2005, Page 805).

Therefore, the coefficient estimates are the same for conditional or
unconditional fixed-effect Poisson model.  That is, in Stata,
"xtpoisson, fe" will return the same results as "xi: poisson
i.group", is the same as "xtpqml, fe".  The only difference is that
"xtpqml, fe" returns "correct" standard errors for QMLE Poisson.
You can also calculate standard errors with the other commands, using
clustered standard errors, or bootstrapped standard errors.


Conditional fixed effect negative binomial model is also possible to
be consistent for some specifications.  But Poission fixed effect is
more popular since it is QMLE.

## Negative Binomial model

The Poisson model has a restrictive property that the conditional
variance equals the conditional mean.  Often we'll see
"overdispersion", that is, the variance exceeds the mean, in real
data.  The negative binomial model is a generalization of poisson
model which allows for overdispersion by introducing an unobserved
heterogeneity term.  In a negative binomial model,

$$
{\rm E} [Y]=\mu \tau = e^{X' \beta} \cdot \tau
$$

This extra $\tau$ term follows a $Gamma(\theta, \theta)$
distribution, with $E(\tau)=1$ and $Var (\tau)=1/\theta$.

Conditional on $X$ and $\tau$, the distribution of $Y$ is still poisson:
$$
{\rm Pr} [Y=y | X, \tau]=\frac{e^{-\mu \tau} (\mu \tau)^y}{y! }
$$

Conditional on $X$ only, the distribution of $Y$ is negative binomial:
$$
{\rm Pr} [Y=y | X]=\frac{\theta^{\theta} \mu^y \Gamma(\theta + y)}{
  \Gamma(y+1) \Gamma(\theta) (\mu + \theta)^{\theta+y}}
$$

This distribution still has conditional mean of $\mu$, but variance is
$\mu (1+(1/\theta) \mu)$.

When $\alpha=1/\theta$ approaches zero, the negative binomial model
converges to poisson model.

## Models for truncated counts

In some situations, all we observe are non-zero counts, because of the
way data was collected.  For example, we only observe people's visits
to a park, only if they visit.  To model how many times they visit,
based on this kind of data set, we need to use zero-truncated count
models.

$$
{\rm Pr} [Y=y | y>0, X]=\frac{{\rm Pr} (y | X) }{{\rm Pr} (y>0 | X)}=
\frac{{\rm Pr} (y | X)}{1- \exp (- \mu)} \label{hurdle}
$$

Thus we are modeling the counts given that we have a positive
outcome.  Both zero-truncated poisson ("ztp" in Stata) and
zero-truncated negative binomial ("ztnb" in Stata) are estimated by
Maximum-likelihood method.

We need to pay extra attention to the "over-dispersion" problem when
dealing with zero-truncated data.  When data is not truncated,
coefficients estimated by poisson model is consistent, even if data is
"overdispersed".  However, if we have zero-truncated sample, then
"over-dispersion" results in inconsistent coefficient estimation
(Grogger and Carson, 1991).  Therefore, "over-dispersion" needs to be
tested before using truncated poisson model or truncated negative
binomial model.

## The hurdle regression model

Although negative binomial model relaxes the assumption of equal mean
and variance, some researchers prefer modeling the process of
generating zeros differently from the process of generating other
values.  Suppose zero counts are generated by a binary process:


$$
{\rm Pr} [y=0 |  X]=\frac{\exp(X \gamma)}{1 + \exp(X \gamma)} = \pi
$$

Positive counts are generated by a truncated count process, such as in
equation \ref{hurdle}.

In this model, zero is a "hurdle" to get past before reaching
positive counts.  The hurdle model is estimated by two seperate
equations.  It is easy to estimate.  However, the marginal effect is
tricky to calcuate, since and independent variable, if apprearing in
both equations, will have effect through both equations.

$$
{\rm E} (y | X) = [\pi \times 0 ] + {(1-\pi) \times {\rm E} (y | y>0,
  X) } = (1- \pi) \times {\rm E} (y | y>0 , X)
$$


In stata, there are commands such as "hplogit", which is a hurdle
model with first equation logit, and second equation truncated
poisson.  It is the same as two seperate estimations; namely "logit"
first, then "ztp" on positive counts.

The difference between hurdle model and a Heckman selection model is
that in a Heckman model, two equations need to be jointly estimated.
There must be exlusion condition to make the selection
equation identifiable.  That is, the second stage equation need to
take account of the selection bias; therefore, some instrument for
selection is needed for the first stage equation.  On the other hand,
a hurdle model assumes that the two processes are seperate; there is
no selection.

## Zero-inflated count models

A zero-inflated count model also models two different processes.  One
is a binary process: generating zero or non-zeros.  The second one is
a count model.  Note there is a different between zero-inflated and
hurdle model:  In hurdle model, the second process is a truncated
count model (positive counts).  In a zero-inflated model, a zero can
come from either the binary process, or from the count process.

A second difference is that the estimation of zero-inflated model is a
joint estimation of the two processes.

$$
y_i \sim \left\{
 \begin{array}{c}
0 \  \mbox{with probability} \ \psi \\    g(y_i | X_i)   \mbox{with
  probability} \ 1- \psi
 \end{array} \right.
$$

Then

$$
P(Y_i=y_i | X_i, Z_i) = \left\{
 \begin{array}{c}
\psi(\gamma' Z_i) + (1- \psi(\gamma' Z_i) ) g(0 | X_i)  \  \mbox{if} \ y_i=0 \\  (1- \psi(\gamma' Z_i) ) g(y_i | X_i)  \  \mbox{if} \ y_i>0
 \end{array} \right.
$$

This says that every non-zero observation follows a count process
$g(y_i|X_i)$. Every zero observation has two possible sources: from a
binary process (with probability $\psi(\gamma' Z_i)$) and from a count
process (with probability $1- \psi(\gamma' Z_i)$ into the count
process and then with probability of $g(0|X_i)$ to be a zero).  The
count process can be a Poisson process ("zip" in Stata) or a
Negative Binomial process ("zinb" in Stata).

## How to interpret coefficients and calculate marginal effects in Discrete Choice Models

### Binary Response Models


In a linear model
$$ y_i= X_i' \beta + \epsilon, $$
$$E(y_i) = X_i' \beta $$


 When $y_i$ is binary (meaning it takes two values, 1 or 0), We can also do an OLS regression on it, but a more popular way is to use a non-linear model.  The most popular choices for modeling binary response are logit model and probit model.  Both of them use the same idea: use a link function to map the binary variable into a continuous variable which is a linear function of the predictors.

Suppose $p_t$ is the probability that $y_i=1$.  Then
$$p_i=E(y_i) = g^{-1}(X_i' \beta), $$
where $g^{-1}()$ is a function that maps from the linear predictor to $y_i$, which is often called index function or inverse link function.

This says that the expectation of $y_i$ (equivalently, $p_i$) is not a linear function of $x_i$'s, but by using the link function, we are still able to model a transformed $p_i$ as a linear function of $x_i$'s:
$$g(p_i) = X_i' \beta. $$

$g^{-1}()$ can be a normal CDF then we have a probit model:
$$ g^{-1}(z) = \Phi (z) = \int_{- \infty}^z \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} {\rm exp} [-(t^2/2)] dt, $$

or it can be a logit:

$$ g^{-1}(z) = \Lambda (z) =  e^z/(1+e^z). $$



### Marginal Effects

Often times we are interested in the marginal effects of the predictors.  In a linear model, it's easy: the coefficient on $x_1$ means when $x_1$ increase by one unit, how much will $y$ increase.

In a binary response model,
$$\frac{\partial p}{\partial  x} = \frac{\partial  g^{-1}(X_i' \beta)}{\partial  x}$$

In the case of probit:

$$\frac{\partial p}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial \Phi (X_i'
  \beta)}{\partial x} = \phi(X_i' \beta) \beta, $$

where $\phi()$ is the density function of normal distribution.

In the case of logit:

$$\frac{\partial p}{\partial  x} = \frac{\partial  \Lambda (X_i' \beta)}{\partial  x} = \gamma(X_i' \beta) \beta, $$
where $\gamma()$ is the density function for logistic distribution:
$$\gamma(X_i' \beta) = \Lambda(X_i' \beta) (1- \Lambda(X_i' \beta)) = p(1-p).$$

Therefore for logit, it's easier to calculate the marginal effect from
coefficient estimate $\beta$, all you have to do is to plug in sample
proportion mean $\bar p$ and coefficient estimate $\hat \beta$:

$$ \hat{ \frac{\partial p}{\partial x}} = \bar p (1- \bar p) \hat \beta $$

The logit model can also be formulated as
$$
\log (\frac{p}{1-p})=\bf X_i' \beta
$$
which says the logarithm of the odds (the ratio of the two
probabilities) is equal to $\bf X_i' \beta$.  Therefore,
$$
p =\frac{\exp( X_i' \beta)}{1+\exp({\bf X}_t
\beta)}=\Lambda( X_i' \beta)
$$



Often times we have discrete valued predictors, such as gender, or other dummy variables.  In that case, it makes more sense to ask what's the effect of gender being 1 vs. 0 (female vs. male).  What this question is can be formulated as:

$$ E(p | x_1=1) - E(p | x_1=0). $$

In empirical analysis, it's often calculated by calculating the predicted probability by setting $x_1$ to 1 and by setting $x_1$ to 0.  Then calculate the difference.


### Count Data Models

In a count data model such as Poisson regression model or Negative Binomial model, we are modeling log of the expected counts:

$$
\log ({\rm E}( y) )=\bf X_i' \beta
$$
Therefore the marginal effect of $x_1$, for example, on ${\rm E} (y)$ is

$$ { \frac{\partial \log {\rm E} (y) }{\partial x}} = \hat \beta , $$

which means $\beta$ is the marginal effect of $x$ on $\log$ of the expected counts. Suppose the expected counts at $x$ is $\mu_{x}$, then

$$ { \frac{(\partial \mu_x) / \mu_x }{\partial x}} = \hat \beta , $$

which says that $\beta$ represents the marginal effect of percentage change in $\mu_x$ with respect to $x$.

Another way to formulate this is to use the Incidence Rate Ratio Interpretation.  Suppose the expected counts at $x$ is $\mu_{x}$, and expected counts at $x+1$ is $\mu_{x+1}$.

$$  \log (\mu_x) = x' \beta. $$

Therefore,

$$
\mu_{x} = \exp (x' \beta),
$$

and

$$
\frac{\mu_{x+1}}{\mu_{x}} = \exp ( \beta).
$$

This says that the exponentiated $\beta$ is the incidence rate ratio of the expected counts, if $x$ increases by $1$.

To calculate the marginal effect of $x$ on $y$ (or ${\rm E} (y)$), we need to calculate

$$\frac{ \partial \mu_x} {\partial x} = \hat \beta \mu_x = \hat \beta \exp(X_i' \hat \beta) , $$
if we evaluate $\mu_x$ at predicted value.

### How to calculate marginal effects in Stata

Stata's margins command is a powerful command to get the predicted value or marginal effects after an estimation command.  Check Stata's manual for more details.



# Panel Data Models

## Background

Panel data are repeated observations on the same "unit" (we call that
cross-sectional units) over time.  Panel data models are used since it
has advantages over cross-sectional models or time-series models.  The
major advantage it has over cross-sectional models is: {\bf{Controlling
  for individual heterogeneity}}.

For example, Baltagi and Levin (1992) studies cigarette demand across
46 states for the years 1963-88.  Consumption is modeled as a function
of lagged consumption, price and income.  These variables vary across
states and time.  However, there are other variables that may be
state-invariant ($z_i$ or time-invariant ($w_t$).  Examples of $z_i$
are religion and education.  For example, Utah, as a Mormon state, has
very low cigarette demand due to religious reason.  Generally we
consider it does not change over time or change very little over time.
Examples of $w_i$ include cigarette commercials on national TV or
radio.  Panel data models are able to control for individual
heterogeneity (or cross-sectional heterogeneity) while cross-sectional
models are not.  In many (or most) social science studies, there is
"unobserved effects" which is embedded in the error term. In other
words, we have "omitted variable" problem.  Without controlling for
it, the estimation results are generally biased and inconsistent.

Panel data give more informative data, more variability and less
collinearity among variables.  Often time series data suffers from
multicollinearity, while panel data has more variability from its
cross-sectional units.

The basic unobserved effects model can be written as:
$$
y_{it}={\bf {x_{it} \beta}} + c_i + u_{it}
\label{eqn:pan1}
$$

where $i$ indexes "units" (can be people, firms, or households,
etc.), an $t$ indexes time periods.

Comparing to regular cross-sectional models, there is an extra term
$c_i$.  $c_i$ can be treated as a random effect or fixed effect.
Traditionally it is distinguished by whether it is estimated as a
random variable or a parameter.  Modern econometrics tends to
distinguish by the correlation between $c_i$ and ${\bf {x_{it}}}$.
If there is no correlation between $c_i$ and ${\bf {x_{it}}}$,
then it's a random effect; otherwise, it's a fixed effect.

It is true that in some cases it is hard to justify that If there is
no correlation between $c_i$ and ${\bf {x_{it}}}$, which is one reason
that people in economics tend to use fixed-effect models.  However,
fixed-effect models have its own limitations.  One of them is: It is
hard to justify that ALL the cross-sectional units' characteristics
other than those already in the model do not change over time.

## Random Effect Methods

A random effect model puts $c_i$ into the error term, then estimate by
FGLS (feasible GLS).  Random effect model is sometimes called
"Error-components model" since the overall error term is divided into
an individual level error term ($c_i$) and individual-time level error
term ($u_{it}$).


Under a random effect model, the variance-covariance matrix of the
error term becomes:


$$
\bf \Omega=
\begin{bmatrix} \sigma_{c}^2 + \sigma_u^2 & \sigma_{c}^2 & \cdots & \sigma_{c}^2
  \\ \sigma_{c}^2 & \sigma_{c}^2 + \sigma_u^2 & \cdots & \sigma_{c}^2 \\ \vdots &
  \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ \sigma_{c}^2  & \sigma_{c}^2  & \cdots & \sigma_{c}^2 + \sigma_u^2
\end{bmatrix}
$$


The random effect estimator is:

$$ \bf \hat \beta_{RE} = (\sum_{i=1}^N X_i' \hat \Omega^{-1} X_i)^{-1} (\sum_{i=1}^N X_i' \hat \Omega^{-1} y_i)$$

It is a special case of GLS.  Before calculating $\hat \beta_{RE}$,
$\sigma_c^2$ and $\sigma_u^2$ need to be estimated.  This is
generally done by using pooled OLS estimates.

\section{Fixed Effect Methods}

Random effect methods assume that $c_i$ be orthogonal to $\bf x_{it}$.
In many applications, the whole point of using panel data is to allow
$c_i$ be correlated with $\bf x_{it}$.  We need fixed-effect models in
those cases.

For the same model as in equation \ref{eqn:pan1}, the fixed-effect
methods try to eliminate $c_i$ using fixed effects transformation, or
"within transformation".  The FE transformation is to "de-mean"
each observation by subtracting the group mean.  Basically subtracting
equation \ref{eqn:pan1} from the following equation:

$$
\bar y_i={\bf \bar x_i \beta} + c_i + \bar u_i
$$

where $\bar y_i$, etc., means group means.  For example, if we have 50 states
with state level data of cigarette consumption across years, then
groups means states, and we have 50 group means which are state level
average cigarette consumption across years.

The reason for "demeaning" is to remove $c_i$ from final estimation.
The "demeaned" regression equation is the final regression used in
estimation:


# Survival Models

## Survival function


Survival analysis is also called time to event analysis or event
history analysis.  We use survival models to analyze data that have the following characteristics:

1. the dependent variable is the waiting time till the occurrence of some event;
2. some observations are censored; that is, some units are not in the data set anymore for some reason before an event happens.  For some units we observe the event and the exact waiting time; for others it has not occurred, and all we know is that the waiting time exceeds the observation time.  However, we believe if they stayed in the study, sooner or later an event would happen.
3.  we are trying to explain (predict) the occurrence of an event with some predictors (explanatory variables).


Let $T$ denote the time variable, a nonnegative, continuous
random variable with PDF $f(t)$ and CDF $F(t)$, where $t$ is a
realization of $T$.  The survival function is defined by

$$
S(t) = Pr(T>t) = 1-F(t)
$$

The graph of $S(t)$ against $t$ is known as the survival curve.  If
there is no censoring, then the survival function is easy to estimate
by the ratio of number of units survives at $t$ vs. total number of
units at risk at $t$.  The most common method to estimate the survival
function with a survival data set containing censored observations is
the Kaplan-Meier method.  The basic idea is to use the product of a series of conditional probabilities.

First sort the event times from the smallest to the largest:


$$
t_{(1)} \le t_{(2)} \le ... \le t_{(r)}
$$


Then the survival curve is estimated by:

$$
\hat S(t) = \prod_{j | t{(j)} \le t} (1-\frac{d_j}{r_j}),
$$

where $r_j$ is the number of units at risk at $t_{(j)}$ and $d_j$ is
the number of "failure" or events at $t_{(t)}$.  Note that units
censored at $t_{(j)}$ are included in $r_j$.

The variance of this estimator can be estimated by:

$$
\hat {var} (S(t)) = (\hat S(t))^2 \sum_{j | t{(j)} \le t} \frac{d_j}{r_j(r_j-d_j)}.
$$



## Hazard function

We are often interested in which periods have the highest or lowest
change of "death" or "failure" or other events.  That is, we may
be interested in the probability that a state ends between $t$ and $t+
\Delta t$ conditional on having reached $t$ in the first place.

The probability is
$$
\mbox{Pr} (t<T \leq t+\Delta t | T \geq t)=\frac{F(t+\Delta
t)-F(t)}{S(t)}
$$

The hazard function is defined by
$$
h(t)=\lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}\mbox{Pr} (t<T \leq t+\Delta t |
T \geq t)=\frac{f(t)}{S(t)}=\frac{f(t)}{1-F(t)}
$$

One of the simplest functional forms is the exponential
distribution
$$
f(t,\theta)=\theta e^{-\theta t}
$$

Therefore, the hazard function is
$$
h(t)=\theta
$$

A much more flexible functional form is Weibull
$$
f(t,\theta, \alpha)=1-\exp(-(\theta t)^{\alpha}).
$$

Hazard function can be shown to be
$$
h(t)=\alpha \theta^{\alpha} t^{\alpha-1}
$$

However, Weibull distribution does not allow for the possibility
that the hazard may first increase then decrease over time.
Log-normal distribution does allow this.

![Various hazard functions from Davidson and MacKinnon](figures/davidson2.jpg)

## Log-likelihood function

Suppose we have $n$ units with a survival function $S(t)$, density $f(t)$, and hazard $h(t)$.
If for unit $i$, the event happens at $t_i$, it's contribution to the likelihood function is the density at that point:

$$
L_i=f(t_i)=S(t_i)h(t_i)
$$


If no event at $t_i$, all we know is that the lifetime exceeds $t_i$.  The probability is
$$
L_i=S(t_i),
$$
which is the contribution to the likelihood function from a censored
observation.

Therefore, if $U$ denotes the set of uncensored observations, the
log-likelihood function for the entire sample can be written as
$$
\ell (t, \theta)=\sum_{i \in U} \log h(t_i | {\bf X}_i,
\theta)+\sum_{i=1}^n \log S(t_i | {\bf X}_i, \theta)
$$

## Proportional Hazard Models

### Model and likelihood

One class of models that is quite widely used is the proportional
hazard models (based on Cox (1972)).
$$
h(t | {\bf x}_i)=h_0(t)\exp ({\bf x}'_i \beta),
\label{cox1}
$$

In this model $h_0(t)$ is called baseline hazard rate; it describes
the risk for units with $\bf x_i = 0$. $\exp ({\bf x}'_i \beta)$
represents the relative risk, a proportionate increase or decrease in
risk, due to $\bf x_i$.  The interpretation of $\beta$ is that
$\exp(\beta_i)$ gives the relative risk change associated with an
increase of one unit in $x_i$, all other explanatory variables remaining
constant.

$\beta$ is estimated by maximizing a partial likelihood function.  It
is partial likelihood function since the baseline hazard is factored
out.  Suppose one event happens at time $t_j$.  Conditional on this
event the probability that case $i$ dies (meaning this event happened
to case $i$, not other cases in the risk set) is


$$
L_i=\frac{h_0(t) \exp(x_i' \beta)} {\sum_l I(T_l \ge t) h_0(t) \exp(x_l' \beta)}=\frac{ \exp(x_i' \beta)} {\sum_l I(T_l \ge t)  \exp(x_l' \beta)}
$$

We can see here that Cox's model is for continuous time survival data.
It is assumed there is no ties at time $t_j$ (in continuous time is
not possible for two events to happen at the same time).  In reality,
we observe ties of event time, because in many situations, we observe
grouped data.  For example, we observe case $m$ and $n$ have events at
the same time $j$.  In that case, in the denominator, whether we include
case $m$ in the calculation of the likelihood of case $n$ is
ambiguous.  In that case, special treatment is needed.  A standard
approximation (Breslow and Peto) is to let

$$
L_{m \in D(t_j)} \simeq \frac{ \prod_{m \in D(t_j)} \exp(x_m' \beta)} {[\sum_{l \in R(t_j)} \exp(x_l' \beta)]^{d_j}}
$$

where $D(t_j)$ is the set of cases that die at time $t_j$ and $d_j$
denotes the number of cases that die at time $t_j$.  This
approximation works well with small number of ties relative to total
number of cases at risk.


One important feature (disadvantage?) for the proportional hazard
model is that for all units, the effect is the same at all time $t$.
To see this:

$$
\frac{h_1(t)}{h_2(t)} = \frac{h_0(t)\exp ({\bf x_1}'_i \beta)}{h_0(t)\exp ({\bf x_2}'_i \beta)}= \frac{\exp ({\bf x_1}'_i \beta)}{\exp ({\bf x_2}'_i \beta)},
$$
which does not depend on $t$.

One advantage of Cox's model is that it is considered as a
semi-parametric model since it does not have to specify the
distribution of the survival time.  The estimation process relies only
on the order in which events occur, not the exact time they occur.
Parameter estimates are derived assuming continuous survival times.

### Interpretation

In equation \ref{cox1}, if we would like to calculate the partial effect of $x_j$ on $h$, we have:

$$
\partial h(t | {\bf x}_i) / \partial x_j=h_0(t)\exp ({\bf x}'_i \beta) \beta_j = \beta_j h(t | {\bf x}_i),
$$

If we do it the other way, plug in $x_j + 1$ will generate

$$
h_0(t)\exp ({\bf x}'_i \beta + \beta_j) = \exp (\beta_j) h(t|{\bf x}'_i \beta)
\label{cox2}
$$


Therefore, one unit change in $x_j$ will have a change of $1- \exp(\beta_j)$ times the original hazard.

## Discrete-time Survival Models

Cox (1972)  proposed a discrete-time model by modeling the odds of dying at time $t_j$ given survival up to that point.

$$
\frac{h(t_j | {\bf x}_i)}{1- h(t_j | {\bf x}_i)} = \frac{h_0(t_j | {\bf x}_i)}{1- h_0(t_j | {\bf x}_i)} \exp({\bf x}'_i \beta),
$$
which is similar to Cox's proportion hazard model for continuous time.  If we take logs on both sides, we have

$$
{\rm logit} (h(t_j | {\bf x}_i)) = \alpha_j +  {\bf x}'_i \beta,
$$
This looks very similar to a logit model.  In fact, we can fit a
discrete-time proportional hazard model by running a logistic
regression on a set of pseudo observations generated by "filling in"
the observations between the start time to the event time or time at
the end of the study period (censored).  The outcome of this process
is 0 unless there is an event, then it turns 1.  It is treated as
independent Bernoulli observations with probability given by hazard
$h_{ij}$ for individual $i$ at time $t_j$.  The likelihood function
for the discrete-time survival model coincide with the binomial
likelihood of independent binomial process (\cite{Sing:Will:it's:1993} has more details).

### Do it in Stata

To do a discrete-time survival model in Stata, your data set needs to
be set up as by unit-time.  For example, observations by company
month.  The event (or failure) variable needs to be set to zero until
the event happens.  If no event until the end of the study period,
then it is censored.  A data set by unit-time can be analyzed by logit
model, optionally with clustered standard error.  To set up a
structure like this, user-written programs called $dthaz$ and
$prsnperd$ (means person-period) can be used.


To do a continuous-time survival model in Stata, your data can be
either set up as discrete-time case (in which case you can use a
time-varying explanatory variable) or a single-record-per-person data
set.  Stata has build-in command $stset$ to set up a survival analysis
structure.  Then you can run $stcox$ for Cox's proportional hazard
model.




# Dynamic Panel Data

## when is it a problem

Model setup:
$$y_{i,t} = \gamma y_{i, t-1} + X \beta + C_i + \epsilon_{i,t}$$

Pooled regression is biased and inconsistent.  The problem is:

$$Cov( y_{i,t-1},  (C_i + \epsilon_{i,t})) \approx \frac{\sigma_c^2}{(1-\gamma)}$$

Random effects model is biased and inconsistent, for the same reason
that $y_{i,t-1}$ is necessarily correlated with $C_i$, which is part
of the composite error term in the random effect model.

Fixed effect model setup:

$$ y_{i,t} - \bar y_i = (X_{i,t} - \bar X_i)' \beta + \gamma (y_{i, t-1} - \bar y_i) + (\epsilon_{i,t} - \bar \epsilon_i)$$

Anderson and Hsiao (1981) show that

$$Cov( (y_{i,t-1}- \bar y_i),  (\epsilon_{i,t} - \bar \epsilon_i )) \approx \frac{\sigma_\epsilon^2}{T (1-\gamma)^2} [\frac{(T-1)-T \gamma + \gamma^T}{T}]$$

which indicates that the correlation between the demeaned lagged $y$
is correlated with the demeaned error term.  The correlation may be
large if $T$ is small, but when $T$ is big, then the correlation goes
down to near zero.  When $T$ is big, we don't have a problem with
fixed effect model.

## how big is the bias

When $T$ is small, which is typically the case in many microeconomic settings, then we say the fixed effect model with a lagged dependent variable is inconsistent.  But how bad is it?

The limit of $\hat \gamma - \gamma$ is approximately $-\frac{(1+\gamma)}{T-1}$.  When $T=10$ and $\gamma=.5$, the bias is about $-0.167$ which is $1/3$ of the true value.

But a simulation study (Judson and Owen 1999) shows that  the bias can be as big as $20\%$  of the true coefficient even when $T=30$.

# Anderson and Hsiao estimator

Anderson and Hsiao (1981) suggested looking at the first difference estimator:

$$ y_{i,t} - y_{i,t-1} = (X_{i,t} - X_{i,t})' \beta + \gamma (y_{i,t-1} - y_{i,t-2}) + (\epsilon_{i,t} - \epsilon{i,t-1}) $$

or

$$ \Delta y_{i,t}= \Delta X_{i,t} \beta + \gamma \Delta y_{i,t-1} + \Delta \epsilon_{i,t} $$

This does not solve the endogeneity problem, since $\Delta y_{i,t-1}$ is still correlated with the error term.  AH's idea is to instrument $\Delta y_{i,t-1}$ with the past level $y_{i,t-2}$, or past difference $y_{i,t-2}-y_{i,t-3}$.  This estimator is consistent, since neither of these instruments is correlated with $\Delta \epsilon_{i,t}$, assuming error is not auto-correlated.


# Arellano-Bond estimator

Arellano and Bond (1991) expanded the idea by using additional lags of the dependent variable as instruments.  For example, both $y_{i,t-2}$ and $y_{i,t-3}$ can be used as instruments.  In fact, as $t$ increases, the number of instruments avialable also increases.  In period 3 only $y_{i,1}$ is available.  In period 4 $y_{i,1}$ and $y_{i,2}$ are available.  In period 5  $y_{i,1}$ and $y_{i,2}$ and  $y_{i,3}$ are availabe, and so on.  In other words, we'll have an instrument matrix with one row for each time period that we are instrumenting:


$$Z_i =
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & \ 0 & \ 0 & \ 0 & \  0 & \ 0 & \ \cdots & \ 0 & \  0 & \ 0 \\ y_{i,1} & \  0 & \ 0 & \ 0
& \  0 & \ 0 & \ \cdots & \ 0 & \  0 & \ 0 \\  0 & \  y_{i,1} & \ y_{i,2} &
\ 0 & \  0 & \ 0 & \ \cdots & \ 0 & \  0 & \ 0 \\  0 & \ 0 & \  0 & \
y_{i,1} & \ y_{i,2} & \ y_{i,3}  & \ \cdots & \ 0 & \  0 & \ 0  \\   \vdots  & \  \vdots & \  \vdots & \  \vdots & \  \vdots & \  \ddots  & \ \cdots & \ \vdots & \  \vdots & \ \vdots \\ 0 & \  0 & \  0 & \ 0 & \ 0 & \ \cdots  & \ 0 & \ y_{i,1} & \  \cdots & \ y_{i,T-2}
\end{bmatrix}
$$


This is the so called difference GMM estimator.

# Blundell and Bond estimator

AB model has a problem:  when the instruments are weak, the estimator is not good.  That will happen when $y$ follows random walk or near random walk.  In that case the past levels won't be a good predictor of the future changes.

BB model comes in to instrument levels with differences. In stead of differencing to remove the fixed effects, it keeps the fixed effects and difference the instruments to make them exogenous to the fixed effects.  The basic idea is that $\Delta y_{i,t}$ is not correlated with $C_i$.  Therefore it can be used as instruments in the fixed effects model without demeaning the variables.

This is implemented by so called system GMM.  In this case, we have fixed effects in the model, but do not attempt to purge the fixed effect by demeaning or first differencing.  Instead, we use past differences of $y$ as instruments, assuming $\Delta y_{i,t}$ is not correlated with $C_i$.  In this case, time-invariant variables can be used in the model.

# Missing data

Data set like:

y x z w q

1 4 2 ? ?

4 ? 1 2 ?

2 ? ?

? 2 1

? ? ?


## Different cases under different assumptions

1. Missing completely at Random (MCAR):  the occurrence of missing data is not related to the missing value, the values of any other variables, or the pattern of missingness in other variables.  Too good to be true situation.

2. Missing at Random (MAR): the occurrence of missing values for a variable is random, contingent on the value or missingness of observable variables.  Or, the missingness can be modeled.

3. Missing Not at Random (MNAR):  the occurrence of missing values is systematically related to unknown or unmeasured covariate factors.  Hopeless situation.

The MAR case is the one we are interested in.

For MCAR:  you lose efficiency if you simply drop the data.
For MAR:  if you don't model it, you suffer bias and efficiency.

If we model missingness, for both MCAR, you gain efficiency.  For MAR, you correct bias and gain efficiency.

## Old methods

1. Listwise deletion

2. Mean imputation.

Problems:
* understates variability in the imputed variable
* does not recover associations between variables.

So standard errors are in general under-estimated.

3. Regression-based imputation

Use a model such as $x=\alpha_0+\alpha_1 z + \alpha_2 y$.  But that introduce extra noise that are not accounted for (similar to generated variable problem).

4. Interpolation of panel data

That is, to use the observation from last period or a linear interpolation for the same unit.

## Modern methods

*  Account for uncertainty in imputed variable

*  Use a model to predict missing observation.

* Instead of picking one, pick many

*  uncertainty is represented by VCV matrix of the coefficients used to predict missing values.

### Basic ideas

Imputation model:  $x=\alpha_0+\alpha_1 z + \alpha_2 y$

Main model:  $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 z$

1.  Pick m values of $\alpha$ out of the asympototic distribution, the multivariate normal, using $\alpha$ and VCV $\hat \Sigma$ for the mean and VCV of the distribution $\Phi (\alpha \Sigma)$.

2. predict $m$ values of the missing values, creating $m$ data sets.

3. calculate $m$ new estimates of $\tilde \beta  = \sum_{m=1}^M \tilde \beta_m$ using each of the imputed data sets.  then calculate the standard error of $\tilde \beta$.

$V_{\beta}=W + (1+1/m) B$

where $W=\frac{1}{m} \sum_{m=1}^M s_m^2$, $B=\frac{1}{m=1}^M (\tilde \beta_m - \tilde \beta)^2$, in other words, the within-imputation and between-imputation variation.

### MI through Chained Equations (MICE) (by Buuren)

1. Discard observations with all missing.

2. Fill in the missing data with random draws from the observed values.

3. Move through the columns and perform single-variable imputation using some method.

4. Replace the original replacements with the fitted replacements.  Repeat 3 for a large number of times, or with a convergence criteria.

5. Do 1-4 $m$ times to create $m$ imputed data sets.

Many ways to implement MICE.

* Regression (linear, logit, multinomial), get $\hat w$ or $f(\hat w)$ sample.

* The default is Predictive Mean Matching (PMM)

  a. create predicted value

  b. pick three cases that have the closed predicted values in terms of Euclidean distance.

  c. randomly choose one of the three values to impute.

### Bayesian Data Augmentation

* MICE is Markov Chain

* Build a missing data model into a Bayesian model, treating missing values as another parameter to estimate by drawing out of its posterior distribution.

$f(\beta, y_{miss}|y_{obs}) \sim f(y_{obs} | \beta, y_{miss}) f(\beta, y_{miss})$


* We integrate out the missing values by sampling from the total distribution, then averaging out the beta distributions over the space of missing data points.

* As long as data is MAR, the likelihood of missingness is not related to $\beta$ (ignorability), this is fine.


### FIML

 If there are no missing data, the likelihood function is

$L(\mu, \Sigma)=\prod_{i=1} f(y_i | \mu, \Sigma)$

If there are missing value,

$L(\mu, \Sigma)=\prod_{i=1} f(y_i | \mu_i, \Sigma_i)$

This is a sample code.  In stata, you have to do "mi set", then "mi register" to register variables you need to impute.  Then "mi impute chained" if you have multiple variables to impute.  Then the imputation will take all variables you registered (imputed or regular) in the prediction model unless you specify otherwise.  Then do "mi estimate".
